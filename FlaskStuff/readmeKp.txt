2/17/2022:
flask-framework is a clone of this repository (https://github.com/thedataincubator/flask-framework)
from 'The Data Incubator' which offers the Data Science Fellowships (for which I also applied in Feb
for a 2 months long session that starts on April 4, 2022). I am waiting on the application decision
at the moment.
