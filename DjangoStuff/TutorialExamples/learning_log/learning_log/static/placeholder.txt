This file ensures that learning_log/static/ will be added to the project.
Django will collect static files and place them in learning_log/static/.

From Page 470 of Python Crash course - Eric Matthes:

On Heroku, Django collects all the static files and places them in one place
so it can manage them efficiently. We’ll create a directory for these static
files. Inside the learning_log folder we’ve been working from is another
folder called learning_log. In this nested folder, make a new folder called
static with the path learning_log/learning_log/static/. We also need to make a
placeholder file to store in this directory for now, because empty directories
won’t be included in the project when it’s pushed to Heroku.
