The directory 'learning_logs' is created by "python manage.py startapp learning_logs", so, it is basically the 'app' which is part of the Django project named 'learning_log'. In other words, the inner 'learning_log' directory contains the essential/backbone codes of the 'learning_log' project along with the 'manage.py' file. We can go on addiing as many apps as we want later on, and correspondingly modify some of the files in the inner 'learning_log' directory.
