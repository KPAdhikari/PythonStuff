    "**Behind the scenes, today’s websites are actually rich applications that act like fully\n",
    "developed desktop applications. Python has a great set of tools for building web applications. In this chapter you’ll learn how to use Django _(http://djangoproject.com/)_ to build a project called Learning Log — an online journal system that lets you keep track of information you’ve learned about particular topics.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll write a specification for this project, and then we’ll define models for the data the app will work with. We’ll use Django’s admin system to enter some initial data and then learn to write views and templates so Django can build the pages of our site.\n",
    "\n",
    "Django is a web framework—a set of tools designed to help you build interactive websites. Django can respond to page requests and make it easier to read and write to a database, manage users, and much more. In Chapters 19 and 20 we’ll refine the Learning Log project and then deploy it to a live server so you (and your friends) can use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Up a Project\n",
    "When beginning a project, you first need to describe the project in a specification,\n",
    "or spec. Then you’ll set up a virtual environment to build the project in.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Writing a Spec\n",
    "A full spec details the project goals, describes the project’s functionality,\n",
    "and discusses its appearance and user interface. Like any good project or\n",
    "business plan, a spec should keep you focused and help keep your project\n",
    "on track. We won’t write a full project spec here, but we’ll lay out a few clear\n",
    "goals to keep our development process focused. Here’s the spec we’ll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to\n",
    "    log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries\n",
    "    as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page\n",
    "    should describe the site and invite users to either register or log\n",
    "    in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,\n",
    "    add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.\n",
    "    \n",
    "When you learn about a new topic, keeping a journal of what you’ve\n",
    "learned can be helpful in tracking and revisiting information. A good app\n",
    "makes this process efficient."
