Copied from page 398 (431 of 562) of Python Crash Course (Eric Matthes):

When beginning a project, you first need to describe the project in a specification,
or spec. Then you’ll set up a virtual environment to build the project
in.


Writing a Spec
A full spec details the project goals, describes the project’s functionality,
and discusses its appearance and user interface. Like any good project or
business plan, a spec should keep you focused and help keep your project
on track. We won’t write a full project spec here, but we’ll lay out a few clear
goals to keep our development process focused. Here’s the spec we’ll use:

      We’ll write a web app called Learning Log that allows users to
log the topics they’re interested in and to make journal entries
as they learn about each topic. The Learning Log home page
should describe the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries.			


When you learn about a new topic, keeping a journal of what you’ve
learned can be helpful in tracking and revisiting information. A good app
makes this process efficient.
