    "The spectrum of states of strongly interacting particles displays some interesting features. Above a typical mass scale of about 1 GeV, there is a large number of states, both meson resonances and baryons. Only a very few (pseudoscalar) states, however, are significantly lighter than this mass scale: in particular the pions ($M_{\\pi} \\approx 140$ MeV), but also kaons ($M_K \\approx 495$ MeV) and the eta ($M_{\\eta} \\approx 550$ MeV).\n",
