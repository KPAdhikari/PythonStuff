    "\n",
    "A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements. A module can define functions, classes and variables. A module can also include runnable code. Grouping related code into a module makes the code easier to understand and use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# A simple module, calc.py \n",
    "  \n",
    "def add(x, y): \n",
    "    return (x+y) \n",
    "  \n",
    "def subtract(x, y): \n",
    "    return (x-y) \n",
    "```\n",
    "### The import statement\n",
    "We can use any Python source file as a module by executing an import statement in some other Python source file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When interpreter encounters an import statement, it <span style=\"color:red\">imports the module if the module is present in the search path</span>. A search path is a list of directories that the interpreter searches for importing a module. For example, to import the module calc.py, we need to put the following command at the top of the script :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# importing  module calc.py \n",
    "import calc \n",
    "  \n",
    "print add(10, 2) \n",
    "```\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    12\n",
    "\n",
    "### The from import Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "Python’s from statement lets you import specific attributes from a module. The from .. import .. has the following syntax :\n",
    "```py\n",
    "# importing sqrt() and factorial from the  \n",
    "# module math \n",
    "from math import sqrt, factorial \n",
    "  \n",

    "Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.0\n",
    "    720\n",
    "\n",
    "### The dir() function\n",
    "The dir() built-in function returns a sorted list of strings containing the names defined by a module. The list contains the names of all the modules, variables and functions that are defined in a module.\n",

    "## Python Modules and Packages – An Introduction\n",
    "by John Sturtz (Ref2 i.e., https://realpython.com/python-modules-packages/)\n",
    "\n",
    "This article explores Python modules and Python packages, two mechanisms that facilitate modular programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular programming refers to the process of breaking a large, unwieldy programming task into separate, smaller, more manageable subtasks or modules. Individual modules can then be cobbled together like building blocks to create a larger application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several advantages to modularizing code in a large application:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Simplicity: Rather than focusing on the entire problem at hand, a module typically focuses on one relatively small portion of the problem. If you’re working on a single module, you’ll have a smaller problem domain to wrap your head around. This makes development easier and less error-prone.\n",
    "* Maintainability: Modules are typically designed so that they enforce logical boundaries between different problem domains. If modules are written in a way that minimizes interdependency, there is decreased likelihood that modifications to a single module will have an impact on other parts of the program. (You may even be able to make changes to a module without having any knowledge of the application outside that module.) This makes it more viable for a team of many programmers to work collaboratively on a large application.\n",
    "* Reusability: Functionality defined in a single module can be easily reused (through an appropriately defined interface) by other parts of the application. This eliminates the need to recreate duplicate code.\n",
    "* Scoping: Modules typically define a separate namespace, which helps avoid collisions between identifiers in different areas of a program. (One of the tenets in the Zen of Python is Namespaces are one honking great idea—let’s do more of those!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Functions, modules and packages are all constructs in Python that promote code modularization."

    "### Python Modules: Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "There are actually three different ways to define a module in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A module can be written in Python itself.\n",
    "* A module can be written in C and loaded dynamically at run-time, like the re (regular expression) module.\n",
    "* A built-in module is intrinsically contained in the interpreter, like the itertools module.\n",
    "\n",
    "A module’s contents are accessed the same way in all three cases: with the import statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the focus will mostly be on modules that are written in Python. The cool thing about modules written in Python is that they are exceedingly straightforward to build. All you need to do is create a file that contains legitimate Python code and then give the file a name with a .py extension. That’s it! No special syntax or voodoo is necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have created a file called mod.py containing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "### mod.py\n",
    "```py\n",
    "s = \"If Comrade Napoleon says it, it must be right.\"\n",
    "a = [100, 200, 300]\n",
    "\n",
    "def foo(arg):\n",
    "    print(f'arg = {arg}')\n",
    "\n",
    "class Foo:\n",
    "    pass\n",

    "    s (a string)\n",
    "    a (a list)\n",
    "    foo() (a function)\n",
    "    Foo (a class)\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming mod.py is in an appropriate location, which you will learn more about shortly, these objects can be accessed by importing the module as follows:\n",

    "Instead, Python follows this convention: if the __init__.py file in the package directory contains a list named __all__, it is taken to be a list of modules that should be imported when the statement from <package_name> import * is encountered.\n",

    "Using import * still isn’t considered terrific form, any more for packages than for modules. But this facility at least gives the creator of the package some control over what happens when import * is specified. (In fact, it provides the capability to disallow it entirely, simply by declining to define __all__ at all. As you have seen, the default behavior for packages is to import nothing.)\n",

    "* “Old-school” String Formatting in Python\n",
    "* f-Strings: A New and Improved Way to Format Strings in Python\n",
    "* Python f-Strings: The Pesky Details\n",
    "* Go Forth and Format!\n",
    "* Further Reading\n",
    "\n",
    "The good news is that **f-strings are here to save the day. They slice! They dice! They make julienne fries! Okay, they do none of those things, but they do make formatting easier.** They joined the party in Python 3.6. You can read all about it in PEP 498, which was written by Eric V. Smith in August of 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called “formatted string literals,” f-strings are string literals that have an f at the beginning and curly braces containing expressions that will be replaced with their values. The expressions are evaluated at runtime and then formatted using the `__format__` protocol. As always, the Python docs are your friend when you want to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some of the ways f-strings can make your life easier.\n",
    "### Simple Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "The syntax is similar to the one you used with str.format() but less verbose. Look at how easily readable this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> name = \"Eric\"\n",
    "    >>> age = 74\n",
    "    >>> f\"Hello, {name}. You are {age}.\"\n",
    "    'Hello, Eric. You are 74.'\n",
    "\n",
    "It would also be valid to use a capital letter F:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> F\"Hello, {name}. You are {age}.\"\n",
    "    'Hello, Eric. You are 74.'\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you love f-strings yet? I hope that, by the end of this article, you’ll answer `>>> F\"Yes!\"`.\n",
    "### Arbitrary Expressions\n",
    "\n",
    "Because f-strings are evaluated at runtime, you can put any and all valid Python expressions in them. This allows you to **do some nifty things**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could do something pretty straightforward, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> f\"{2 * 37}\"\n",
    "    '74'\n",
    "\n",
    "But you could also call functions. Here’s an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> def to_lowercase(input):\n",
    "    ...     return input.lower()\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> name = \"Eric Idle\"\n",
    "    >>> f\"{to_lowercase(name)} is funny.\"\n",
    "    'eric idle is funny.'\n",
    "\n",
    "You also have the option of calling a method directly:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> f\"{name.lower()} is funny.\"\n",
    "    'eric idle is funny.'\n",
    "\n",
    "You could even use objects created from classes with f-strings. Imagine you had the following class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```py\n",
    "class Comedian:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):\n",
    "        self.first_name = first_name\n",
    "        self.last_name = last_name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __str__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} is {self.age}.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    def __repr__(self):\n",
    "        return f\"{self.first_name} {self.last_name} is {self.age}. Surprise!\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "You’d be able to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    >>> new_comedian = Comedian(\"Eric\", \"Idle\", \"74\")\n",
    "    >>> f\"{new_comedian}\"\n",
    "    'Eric Idle is 74.'\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__str__()` and `__repr__()` methods deal with how objects are presented as strings, so you’ll need to make sure you include at least one of those methods in your class definition. If you have to pick one, go with `__repr__()` because it can be used in place of `__str__()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The string returned by `__str__()` is the informal string representation of an object and should be readable. The string returned by `__repr__()` is the official representation and should be unambiguous. Calling str() and repr() is preferable to using `__str__()` and `__repr__()` directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, f-strings will use `__str__()`, but you can make sure they use `__repr__()` if you include the conversion flag !r:\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> f\"{new_comedian}\"\n",
    "'Eric Idle is 74.'\n",
    ">>> f\"{new_comedian!r}\"\n",
    "'Eric Idle is 74. Surprise!'\n",
    "\n",
    "If you’d like to read some of the conversation that resulted in f-strings supporting full Python expressions, you can do so here."

    "    “F-strings provide a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using a minimal syntax.

Operator overloading, for example, can get pretty obscure.** Adding “karma” to a person object with `+bob or tim << 3` is definitely possible using dunders — but might not be the most obvious or appropriate way to use these special methods. However, for common operations like comparison and additions they can be an elegant approach.\n",
