    "* All variables in Python are objects\n",
    "* Objects sit in heap, whereas their references and function/method calls sit in stack (stack-frames)\n",
    "* Python's Garbage Collection (GC) uses **Reference Counting** algorithm, in which the interpreter keeps tab (kp: a table) of the # of references of an object and as soon as the number reaches zero, the object is swept out of memory by the GC. <font color='magenta'>(Ref4 says Python GC uses both **Reference Counting** and **Tracing**. Tracing generally uses **Mark and Sweep (MARK)** algorithm. Python uses something called **Generational** tracing.)</font>\n",
    "    * <font color='magenta'>Generational GC is based on the theory that **most objects die young.**</font>\n",
    "    * <font color='magenta'>Python maintains a list of every object created as a program is run. Actually, three lists - Generation 0, Generation 1 and Generation 2. Each object is stored in only one generation. Newest objects are stored in **Generation 0**</font>\n",
    "    * Different languages use different algorithms for GC with their unique advantages and disadvantages. For example, the Java GC uses a different algorithm known as **Mark-and-Sweep (MARK)** in which it marks the unreferenced object but sweeping (garbage collection) is done periodically rather than instantly or immediately. (watch at about 6:00)\n",
    "        * Ref5: MARK algorithm gets run when the # of objects in the memory is greater than a certain threshold. The next step is Sweep which will remove the dead objects.\n",
    "    * Advantages of **Reference Counting** - optimal memory utilization (beneficial for limited memory situation).\n",
    "    * Disadvantages - slows down the program execution.\n",
    "        * From Ref4 - (1) space overhead (needs storage space to store ref-count); (2) execution overhead (slows down execution); (3) not generally thread safe. (4) doesn't detect cyclical references."

    "If you are new to Python, you might be confused about the different versions that are available. Although Python 3 is the latest generation of the language, many programmers still use Python 2.7, the final update to Python 2, which was released in 2010.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently no clear-cut answer to the question of which version of Python you should use; the decision depends on what you want to achieve. While Python 3 is clearly the future of the language, some programmers choose to remain with Python 2.7 because some older libraries and packages only work in Python 2.\n",
    "## Why Are There Different Versions of Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming languages constantly evolve as developers extend the functionality of the language and iron out quirks that cause problems for developers. Python 3 was introduced in 2008 with the aim of making Python easier to use and change the way it handles strings to match the demands placed on the language today. Programmers who first learned to program in Python 2 sometimes find the new changes difficult to adjust to, but newcomers often find that the new version of the language makes more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3.0 is fundamentally different to previous Python releases because it is the first Python release that is not compatible with older versions. Programmers usually don’t need to worry about minor updates (e.g. from 2.6 to 2.7) as they usually only change the internal workings of Python and don’t require programmers to change their syntax. The change between Python 2.7 (the final version of Python 2) and Python 3.0 is much more significant — code that worked in Python 2.7 may need to be written in a different way to work in Python 3.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences Between Python 2 and Python 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some key differences between Python 2 and Python 3 that can make the new version of the language less confusing for new programmers to learn:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Print:__ In Python 2, “print” is treated as a statement rather than a function. There is no need to wrap the text you want to print in parentheses, although you can if you want. This can be confusing, as most other actions in Python use functions that require the arguments to be placed inside parentheses. It can also lead to unexpected outcomes if you put parentheses around a comma-separated list of items that you want to print. In contrast, Python 3 explicitly treats “print” as a function, which means you have to pass the items you need to print to the function in parentheses in the standard way, or you will get a syntax error. Some Python 2 programmers find this change annoying, but it can help to prevent mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Integer Division:__ Python 2 treats numbers that you type without any digits after the decimal point as integers, which can lead to some unexpected results during division. For example, if you type the expression 3 / 2 in Python 2 code, the result of the evaluation will be 1, not 1.5 as you might expect. This is because Python 2 assumes that you want the result of your division to be an integer, so it rounds the calculation down to the nearest whole number. In order to get the result 1.5, you would have to write 3.0 / 2.0 to tell Python that you want it to return a float, that is, to include digits after the decimal point in the result. Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "__List Comprehension Loop Variables:__ In previous versions of Python, giving the variable that is iterated over in a list comprehension the same name as a global variable could lead to the value of the global variable being changed — something you usually don’t want. This irritating bug has been fixed in Python 3, so you can use a variable name you already used for the control variable in your list comprehension without worrying about it leaking out and messing with the values of the variables in the rest of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Unicode Strings:__ Python 3 stores strings as Unicode by default, whereas Python 2 requires you to mark a string with a “u” if you want to store it as Unicode. Unicode strings are more versatile than ASCII strings, which are the Python 2 default, as they can store letters from foreign languages as well as emoji and the standard Roman letters and numerals. You can still label your Unicode strings with a “u” if you want to make sure your Python 3 code is compatible with Python 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Raising Exceptions:__ Python 3 requires different syntax for raising exceptions. If you want to output an error message to the user, you need to use the syntax:   (kp: _It seems this change is similar to that of **print**_)\n",
    "\n",
    "raise IOError(“your error message”)\n",
    "\n",
    "This syntax works in Python 2 as well. The following code works only in Python 2, not Python 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "raise IOError, “your error message”\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many other examples of slight differences in syntax between Python 2 and Python 3. A cheat sheet of key syntax differences is available from Python-Future to help you write code that is compatible with both versions of Python. In addition to syntax differences, there are other key differences, such as how the two versions of Python handle strings, as described above. Python 3.3 performs at approximately the same speed as Python 2.7, although some benchmarks measure the new language as being much faster."

    "### Integer Division: \n",
    "Python 2 treats numbers that you type without any digits after the decimal point as integers, which can lead to some unexpected results during division. For example, if you type the expression 3 / 2 in Python 2 code, the result of the evaluation will be 1, not 1.5 as you might expect. This is because Python 2 assumes that you want the result of your division to be an integer, so it rounds the calculation down to the nearest whole number. In order to get the result 1.5, you would have to write 3.0 / 2.0 to tell Python that you want it to return a float, that is, to include digits after the decimal point in the result. Python 3 evaluates 3 / 2 as 1.5 by default, which is more intuitive for new programmers.\n",
