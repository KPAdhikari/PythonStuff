    "\n",
    "It’s important to note that the term “package” in this context is being used as a synonym for a [distribution](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package) (i.e. a bundle of software to be installed), not to refer to the kind of [package](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-import-package) that you import in your Python source code (i.e. a container of modules). It is common in the Python community to refer to a [distribution](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package) using the term “package”. Using the term “distribution” is often not preferred, because it can easily be confused with a Linux distribution, or another larger software distribution like Python itself.\n",

    "### Ensure you can run Python from the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you go any further, make sure you have Python and that the expected version is available from your command line. You can check this by running:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should get some output like Python 3.6.3. If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from python.org or refer to the Installing Python section of the Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you’re a newcomer and you get an error like this:\n",

    ">>> python --version\n",

    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "NameError: name 'python' is not defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "It’s because this command and other suggested commands in this tutorial are intended to be run in a shell (also called a terminal or console). See the Python for Beginners [getting started tutorial](https://opentechschool.github.io/python-beginners/en/getting_started.html#what-is-python-exactly) for an introduction to using your operating system’s shell and interacting with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If you’re using an enhanced shell like IPython or the Jupyter notebook, you can run system commands like those in this tutorial by prefacing them with a ! character:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    In [1]: import sys\n",
    "            !{sys.executable} --version\n",
    "    Python 3.6.3\n",
    "```\n",
    "It’s recommended to write {sys.executable} rather than plain python in order to ensure that commands are run in the Python installation matching the currently running notebook (which may not be the same Python installation that the python command refers to).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Due to the way most Linux distributions are handling the Python 3 migration, Linux users using the system Python without creating a virtual environment first should replace the python command in this tutorial with python3 and the pip command with `pip3 --user`. Do not run any of the commands in this tutorial with `sudo`: if you get a permissions error, come back to the section on creating virtual environments, set one up, and then continue with the tutorial as written.\n"

    "### Creating Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Python “Virtual Environments” allow Python [packages](https://packaging.python.org/glossary/#term-distribution-package) to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally. If you are looking to safely install global command line tools, see [Installing stand alone command line tools](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-stand-alone-command-line-tools/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another application requires version 2. How can you use both these applications? If you install everything into /usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages (or whatever your platform’s standard location is), it’s easy to end up in a situation where you unintentionally upgrade an application that shouldn’t be upgraded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or more generally, what if you want to install an application and leave it be? If an application works, any change in its libraries or the versions of those libraries can break the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, what if you can’t install packages into the global site-packages directory? For instance, on a shared host.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all these cases, virtual environments can help you. They have their own installation directories and they don’t share libraries with other virtual environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, there are two common tools for creating Python virtual environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) is available by default in Python 3.3 and later, and installs [pip](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pip) and [setuptools](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#setuptools) into created virtual environments in Python 3.4 and later.\n",
    "* [virtualenv](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#virtualenv) needs to be installed separately, but supports Python 2.7+ and Python 3.3+, and **pip, setuptools** and [wheel](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#wheel) are always installed into created virtual environments by default (regardless of Python version).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic usage is like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "Using venv:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "python3 -m venv <DIR>\n",
    "source <DIR>/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "Using virtualenv:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "virtualenv <DIR>\n",
    "source <DIR>/bin/activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "For more information, see the [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) docs or the [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.pypa.io/) docs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of `source` under Unix shells ensures that the virtual environment’s variables are set within the current shell, and not in a subprocess (which then disappears, having no useful effect).\n",
    "\n",
    "In both of the above cases, Windows users **should _not_ use** the `source` command, but should rather run the activate script directly from the command shell like so:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "<DIR>\\Scripts\\activate\n",
    "```\n",
    "Managing multiple virtual environments directly can become tedious, so the [dependency management tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/managing-dependencies/#managing-dependencies) introduces a higher level tool, [Pipenv](https://packaging.python.org/key_projects/#pipenv), that automatically manages a separate virtual environment for each project and application that you work on.\n"
