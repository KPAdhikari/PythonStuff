    "## The `typedef` keyword in C and C++\n",
    "Refs:\n",
    "* https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/typedef.html\n",
    "\n",
    "By Alex Allain\n",
    "\n",
    "The typedef keyword allows the programmer to create new names for types such as int or, more commonly in C++, templated types--it literally stands for \"type definition\". Typedefs can be used both to provide more clarity to your code and to make it easier to make changes to the underlying data types that you use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a type? No, really, what does it mean?\n",
    "One purpose of having types is to make sure that variables are always used in the way that they were intended to be used. C and C++ provide several built-in types that are based on the underlying representation of the data. Sometimes this is good enough; when you're working to save memory or perform numerical computations that require the right level of precision, you want to have tight control over these matters.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, many times, you don't care so much about the underlying representation of data--is it a float or an int or a double--as much as you care about how it will be used. For instance, you might have some variables that always store information about the user's current score in a game or how many points the player can get from performing an action like killing an enemy. You might also have some variables that are intended to keep track of the amount of life left for the player and how many life points he can receive for picking up life-enhancers. These two concepts are totally different, and there's no time when you'd ever want to store one type of data--for instance, the number of points--in a variable that is intended for the other type--the amount of life points a player has or can gain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know from the start that these two concepts are totally different, even if you store both of them as integers. By thinking of the two types of data as different \"data types\", you give yourself a useful way to add an element of defensive programming to your code by making it clear what type each variable is associated with--for example, you might prefix all variables storing information about life with an l, and about scores with an s. You'd never expect an assignment from lhigh to shigh--the two concepts are fundamentally incompatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of actually enforcing this constraint is to actually create \"wrapper\" classes for the different types. This allows your compiler to spot incorrect assignments and prevent you from making them.\n",
    "### The Role of Typedefs\n",
    "Another partial solution to this problem is to use typedefs. This won't give you quite as much safety as having wrapper classes, but it does mean that you can at least make it clear what a function is supposed to return. If you see\n",
    "```\t\n",
    "life_t get_high();\n",
    "```\n",
    "then you know that get_high returns the highest possible life value your player can have, not the high score. Of course, the naming here is a bit suspect--you could have written the function name as get_high_life instead. But having the return type as a life_t makes it extra-clear what should be returned. In cases where you have a function return multiple values by both returning a value and setting memory passed in via pointer, this can be especially useful:\n",
    "```cpp\t\n",
    "error_t get_data( char *data );\n",
    "```\n",
    "It's now clear that the get_data function returns some kind of error type, not the data that presumably will be returned via the data pointer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typedefs help you here because can be used to give more specific names for built-in types: for instance, you will often see the size_t type used instead of a plain old unsigned int when it's useful to make clear that the value is expected to be used as a size--for example, the strlen function returns a \"size_t\" type instead of an unsigned int.\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "So, how do you actually declare a typedef? All you must do is provide the old type name followed by the type that should represent it throughout the code. Here's how you would declare size_t to be an unsigned integer:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "typedef unsigned int size_t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "From here on out, you would be able to use size_t instead of unsigned int. Note that in C, typedefs can also be used to remove some of the burden associated with declaring structs. In C, struct variables must be declared by a combination of the keyword struct and the name of the struct:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "struct my_struct_type my_struct_variable;\n",
    "```\n",
    "This can be annoying, so some programmers use typedef to create shorter names:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "typedef struct my_struct_type my_short_type_t;\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Typedefs and Abstraction\n",
    "Typedefs provide a level of abstraction away from the actual types being used, allowing you, the programmer, to focus more on the concept of just what a variable should mean. This makes it easier to write clean code, but it also makes it far easier to modify your code. For instance, if if you decided you really needed to support sizes that were too big to store in an unsigned int, you could make a change in one place in your code--the typedef itself--to make size_t equivalent to, for instance, an unsigned long. Almost none of your code would need to change!\n",
    "\n",
    "This method of using typedefs is can also be a convenience; C++ template types can be exceptionally long and annoying to type, especially when making heavy use of the STL. Typedefs allow you to easily create abbreviations for these long type names, with the added bonus that they make it much easier to make changes throughout your code if you want to change the templated type.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have a map of strings to ints, you could declare it as\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "std::map<string, int>\n",
    "```\n",
    "everywhere in your code. But this is a lot of typing, and annoying punctuation. Moreover, it doesn't give you any information about what it actually means. Using a typedef here saves both typing and adds clarity.\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "typedef std::map<string, int> ScoreByName;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now it's clear that this map is designed to store the scores associated with different individuals. Moreover, if you decided that you wanted scores to be floating point numbers, you'd have no trouble changing it from mapping scores as integers to scores as floating point numbers.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "The good\n",
    "\n",
    "* Typedefs can make your code more clear\n",
    "* Typedefs can make your code easier to modify\n",
    "\n",
    "The gotchas\n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to keep in mind when using typedefs is that the underlying type might matter; avoid typedefs, or make them easy to find, when it's important to know the underlying data type "

    "## \"using\" vs \"typedef\" in modern C++ (Two ways of defining type aliases for a smarter code.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the beginning of C you can add synonyms to types that otherwise would be too complex or not much meaningful to work with. In a nutshell, you give an existing type, e.g. int, a new name, e.g. Pixel. Known as type aliases, they help you keep your code clean, short and understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say for example you are working with a graphical library. Compare the following two functions:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "int getScreenWidth();\n",
    "\n",
    "// Or ... \n",
    "\n",
    "Pixel getScreenWidth();\n",
    "```\n",
    "The latter is clearly more intuitive: having declared the alias Pixel it is obvious what this function is about. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another example:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> map;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Or ... \n",
    "\n",
    "Map map;\n",
    "```\n",
    "I think you get the picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "However keep in mind that a type alias does not create a new type: it only generates a synonym, or another way of calling the underlying one. The alias Pixel is still an int and Map is still that frightening `std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>` and they can be used with functions that accept ints and `std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>`s as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Declaring new aliases\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of declaring new type aliases in modern C++. The first and traditional one is with the typedef keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "typedef [original-type] [your-alias];\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "typedef int Pixel;\n",
    "typedef std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> Map;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The other one, introduced in C++11, is with the using keyword:\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "using [your-alias] = [original-type];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For example\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "using Pixel = int;\n",
    "using Map   = std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is identical: either way you will end up with new names Pixel and Map that you can use everywhere you need. But...\n",
    "\n",
    "### using works best with templates\n",
    "\n",
    "The alias Map created in the two examples above (both with typedef and using) has its original type set in stone: it will always be a `std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>>` and there is no way to change it, for example into a `std::map<int, std::vector<int>>,` unless you don't declare a new alias with that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately the C++11's using has the ability to create the so-called alias template: an alias that keeps an open door to the underlying type. You can have the usual type aliasing and the ability to specify the template parameter(s) in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is how to declare an alias template:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "template<[template-parameter-list]> using [your-alias] = [original-type];\n",
    "```\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "template<typename T1, typename T2> using Map = std::map<T1, std::vector<T2>>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now I can define new Map variables of different types:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "// Actual type: std::map<std::string, std::vector<std::string>> (as in the original example)\n",
    "Map<std::string, std::string> map1;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Actual type: std::map<int, std::vector<int>>\n",
    "Map<int, int> map2;\n",
    "\n",
    "// Actual type: std::map<int, std::vector<float>>\n",
    "Map<int, float> map3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Such behavior could be replicated with the traditional typedef, but it's way trickier and it's not worth it.\n",
    "### A template declaration cannot appear at block scope\n",
    "\n",
    "You can put type alias declarations — both performed with typedef or using — everywhere you wish: in namespaces, in classes and inside blocks (i.e. between { and }).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alias templates on the other hand follow the same rules of any other templated thing in C++: they cannot appear inside a block. They are actual template declarations, after all!\n",

    "\n",
    "Write two functions in C using GCC compiler, one of which executes before main function and other executes after the main function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### GCC specific syntaxes :\n",
    "1. **`__attribute__`((constructor)) syntax :** This particular GCC syntax, when used with a function, executes the same function at the startup of the program, i.e before main() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`__attribute__`((destructor)) syntax :** This particular GCC syntax, when used with a function, executes the same function just before the program terminates through `_exit`, i.e after main() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation :\n",
    "The way constructors and destructors work is that the shared object file _(kp: compiled binary files, not containing C++ objects)_ contains special sections (.ctors and .dtors on ELF) which contain references to the functions marked with the constructor and destructor attributes, respectively. When the library is loaded/unloaded, the dynamic loader program checks whether such sections exist, and if so, calls the functions referenced therein.\n",
    "\n",
    "Few points regarding these are worth noting :\n",
    "1. `__attribute__((constructor))` runs when a shared library is loaded, typically during program startup.\n",
    "2. `__attribute__((destructor))` runs when the shared library is unloaded, typically at program exit.\n",

    "### Importance of macros in C++\n",
    "\n",
    "99.9% of the C++ programs use macros. Unless you are making a basic file you have to write `#include`, which is a macro that pastes the text contained in a file. And it matters not the extension of the file. Macros are very powerful and can do things that not even **templates, lambdas, constexpr, inlining** or whatever future compiler constructs will ever do.\n",
    "\n",
    "The thing about the CPP compiler, and generally compilers, or the language, is that it is designed to restrict accidents. Such as using a type as another type, not setting object state before using object, not releasing memory, using a garbage value, in case of java – accessing out of bounds memory, etc etc. This is all fine and good, in fact errors get caught easier, but on the other hand, it restricts programmer from doing useful stuff.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then language creators end up having to devise means of getting around these restrictions. For example, Java has their JNI library for connecting to C and C++ DLLs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Problem is Java does not have macros. Furthermore Java is a very verbatim language. \n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Java.util.something.member(..... \n",
    "```\n",
    "On the other hand, C++ can use macros for shorter names.\n",
    "\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "#define BIT64 (8) \n",
    "#define TYPE std::conditional<size of(int) == BIT64, int, short>::type \n",
    "#define TRUE (std::is_same<TYPE, int>::value) \n",
    "#define TRY_ENABLE std::enable_if<TRUE, TYPE>::type \n",
    "  \n",
    "TRY_ENABLE func(){}; \n",
    "  \n",
    "#undef // every definition \n",
    "```\n",
    "These illustrate many uses of macros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can turn a long declaration into a short declaration.\n",
    "* With a name that gives the statement a meaning, its easier to understand the macro than the lengthy code behind it.\n",
    "* It is straight to the point. Doesn’t need to be in a namespace or pollute the namespace with **using** declaration.\n",
    "* Macros don’t clean up after themselves, but that’s good, a programmer can decide when the Macro needs to exist and clean up so that another file can use the macro comfortably. Compare that to CPP using directive that persist for ever.\n",
    "* Also since macros originated from C, what you see is what you get. What you C. Get it! The ++ in C++ means C in doubles. With things like ADL, default created constructors, they are a lot of ways for CPP to knock you out. Macros on the other hand are very simple, yet very powerful.\n",
    "* Also notice how number 8 got turned into an identified name. The CPP alternative is **const variables, constexpr functions**. Probably constexpr provides the same results with no runtime over head. But declaring a const variable just to make code more readable seems as waste of memory. Why allocate memory just to give a name to a value? Then when you pass that variable to a parameter you might incur another memory allocation cost. With the Macro only one allocation cost is made. That is passing the macro value to the parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, macros not only make names shorter, and in fact **typedefs** and **ref alias** can also be used to make names shorter, but macros can also avoid runtime overheads. Macros happen way before runtime. Macros have been avoiding run time overheads way before CPP features such as **move** and **template**."
