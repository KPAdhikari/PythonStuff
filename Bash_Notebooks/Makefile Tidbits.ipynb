    "* It seems that make cannot parse filenames properly if the name is too long. For example, when i was trying to compile my STEG generator files, my main file was initially named \"stegAllmyOwnV1_27_13NoAvgXSinBinMultSc.f\" it reported \"gfortran error: stegAllmyOwnV1_27_13NoAvgXSinBinMultSc.o: No such file or directory\". But when I renamed the file as \"stegAllmyOwnNoAvgXSinBinMultSc.f\", it worked. Initially, Lamiaa's version of the file was also compiling because she had chosen a smaller name for her main file."

    "all:\n",
    "```\n",
    "What's the value of X? The small size and simplicity of this Makefile means that tracing through all the variable assignments is feasible, leading to the conclusion the X is “dogs hate cats”. In a real multi-thousand line Makefile that unleashes the power of GNU Make's variables and functions figuring out the value of a variable can be a laborious task. But here's a little Make recipe that does all the work for you. Create a Makefile called helper.mak and place in it:\n",

    "print-%:\n",
    "\n",
    "@echo $* = $($*)\n",

    "gmake -f Makefile -f helper.mak print-X\n",
    "\n",
    "The first -f Makefile tells GNU Make to load our original Makefile, and the second -f helper.mak loads in the receipe. The print-X directs make to “build” the target named print-X. Since there isn't an explicit rule to build print-X GNU Make looks for a pattern and finds print-% (the % acts as a wildcard) and runs the associated command.\n",
    "\n",
    "The command uses ```$*``` (a special GNU Make variable that will have the value matched by the % in the rule) to print the name of the variable and then by doing ```$($*)``` gets the value of the variable named by ```$*```. So experimenting with it we can see the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$ gmake -f Makefile -f helper.mak print-X\n",
    "X = dogs hate cats\n",
    "$ gmake -f Makefile -f helper.mak print-YS\n",
    "YS = dogs\n",
    "$ gmake -f Makefile -f helper.mak print-S\n",
    "S = s\n",

    "\n",
    "Sometimes it's useful to know how a variable was defined. GNU Make provides the $(origin) function that returns a string containing the type of the variable\n",
    "\n",
    "(e.g. Whether it was defined in a Makefile, on the command-line, or in the environment). Modifying helper.mak prints out origin information as well.\n",
    "```\n",
    "print-%:\n",
    "@echo $* = $($*)\n",
    "@echo $*\\'s origin is $(origin $*) \n",
