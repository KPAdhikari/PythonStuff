    "Maven strikes me as a case of something written by a bunch of past-their-sell-by-date c-shell script kiddies who think autoconf is leading edge code automation and don't understand that object code requires an object environment to be in any way efficient either for development or deployment. Ant was bad enough, but Maven combines all the worst features of Ant and Ivy. It doesn't create an object environment, and it doesn't play well with tools that do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, an object environment should have all class objects, i.e. the objects that determine the types of objects available to the system, live and available at all times. From there I can do whatever I want, instantiate multiple objects of a class, set up various sequences and instantiation rules, etc. Since the environment should be completely live, I shouldn't need a build tool at all. In terms of deploying my app, it's not difficult for the environment to simply throw out all the class objects that are never referenced by code in the namespaces that make up my app. The garbage collector in the JVM does almost the same thing on the fly today. At that point I have a deployment environment made up of my objects and all the objects (primarily class objects) that my objects reference, i.e. my application and all dependencies. This is how virtual machines work. (that our VMs are so poorly written we need to run a Spring VM on a Java VM on a Linux VM on a VMWare VM on another Linux VM is another example of the idiocy of software development). When dependencies get updated, it's simple enough for the environment to prompt the developer to merge his old code to the new libs, merge the code using the new libs down to the older version, or keep both versions. Prompting encourages the developer to make the slight modifications that are sometimes necessary to avoid having twenty versions of every library, while tools like Maven hide the fact that you have twenty versions and result in the massive runtime bloat common in Java apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Java development space Eclipse comes closest to being a proper object environment, although granted there are plenty of plugins that break the paradigm in various ways. Most of the reasons given for using Maven fall apart when examined critically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netbeans and Idea are overblown text editors, not object environments, but if you do want to use their tools for something not covered by the thousands of Eclipse plugins, both can import and maintain Eclipse projects, your build will just be inordinately slow compared to developers using Eclipse, but then, they'd be that slow if they were pure Netbeans or Idea projects anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a serious reason to use Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ease of exporting / importing settings in Eclipse (something every team should do in any IDE in any case) makes the different settings problem nothing more than laziness on the part of the development team (or a religious argument over spaces vs tabs, lol).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, not a serious reason to use Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team environment? Show me a team that doesn't already use a repository like GIT or SVN. Why do we need to duplicate both the functionality and the maintenance headache by setting up Nexus repos as well?\n",
    "\n",
    "That one's actually a good reason NOT to use Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a server build? Great idea, now, shouldn't that be kicked off by code that's actually checked in to the source repo rather than a random build that happens to get pushed to Nexus? This brings up a point against Git, particularly Git with Maven. Since in Git I don't work on a branch, test locally, then commit (partly because my local test doesn't prove the server build works due to differences in the Maven configuration in Jenkins and Eclipse) I have to commit my changes to a different branch in order to see that the server Maven build fails, then commit a further change to fix the problem, resulting in an unreadable source history in the repo. Checked in code should at the very least build and pass unit tests, which if Git and Maven were out of the picture should be guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exporting a headless build from Eclipse is trivial if you actually look into it - all you need is ant or Gradle, the developer build already maintained by Eclipse, and a few Eclipse jars (Eclipse will export all the necessary files for a headless build to a directory or zip file, or ftp them to the build server). Server build tools like Hudson/Jenkins can pull updated code from most source repos and call any build script, there's no dependency on Maven. With Maven you either force developers to use a tool not suited to anybody but build engineers (the magnitudes longer it takes to build, even using M2E, is sufficient for that case to be made), or you live with the possibility that the server build doesn't work quite like the workstation build, which is still true if you go through all the hassle of integrating the two using the plethora of M2E plugins. Either way you get a slower and more fragile workstation build for the sake of an equally slow and more fragile server build. On every Maven based project I've worked on I've seen transient Hudson/Jenkins errors that don't show up in Eclipse unless you have absolutely every possible M2E plugin installed and correctly configured, and most developers never do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems like another great reason to avoid Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't cover some of the more fundamental problems with Maven, such as its namespaces breaking Java namespaces and XML namespaces, it's build unit (the POM) having no relation to anything in the actual deployment environment (think about it, when you separate via POMs what are you actually accomplishing in the finished product? Nothing. All it accomplishes is a false sense that you've separated concerns and functionality into different build units that all run as one monolithic piece of code); the hassle of manually maintaining complex configuration files, which only gets worse if you happen to need to use OSGi or another container and have to maintain other config files that affect and are affected by the Maven config with very little obvious sense to it; the problems caused by trying to run unit tests without a full environment for the code to execute in; the myriad versions not only of dependencies but of Maven specific plugins (I've actually seen JAR hell in the Maven build itself where multiple Maven plugins were using conflicting dependencies - one of the problems Maven was supposed to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you can build object code with Maven. You can also write pure object code in C or even assembler, but I don't know why you'd want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best reason to avoid Maven is the phenomenal amount of work required to de-mavenize a set of projects when you get sick of all the problems noted above (and numerous others not mentioned).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mindset, inherited from C development, that the development cycle consists of write code, compile, assemble, build, deploy, test, do over again, is hopelessly outdated in an object environment. At some point we need to tell all the people with this mindset that they need to relearn how to develop, period. Doing so would remove any need for Maven, Git, and a host of other tools that do nothing but waste time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object development should be done in a live object environment, where a code change is tested as it is saved since the modified object is live. Deployment should consist of removing development only artefacts from that environment, creating a runtime that has everything used by the running app in development and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm currently dealing with a problem caused by creating deployment assemblies for an OSGi app using the maven-assembly plugin. The app works perfectly in the Eclipse environment, which hot deploys all code changes into a running OSGi container within the environment. However the configuration doesn't survive intact through the maven-assembly process, despite having a very good configuration/build engineer whose sole job is to accomplish that process. If we got rid of Maven (very difficult now due to the amount of code, but possible) and used the BNDTOOLS Eclipse plugin we could simply export the Eclipse build as an Ant or Gradle headless build (note, the OSGi developers who write BND and BNDTOOLS don't support Maven, and for good reason, the Maven plugin is written by the Felix developers who themselves use Netbeans and Maven, and no live environment other than at the end of the deploy cycle), where both tools set up the same environment as Eclipse, without the GUI objects that are only meant for developers anyway. The result would be an identical configuration and build for deployment. This would easily save 2-3 hours per day per developer currently spent watching slow Maven or M2E builds, and free up the config/build engineer to do more testing of the app on the deployment hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting over the mindset of write/compile/assemble/build/deploy/test is the only major impediment. Pretending you're coding on a 1979 VT100 terminal instead of a modern machine doesn't make you a 'real' developer, it just demonstrates that your methods are 35 years out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the developers on the team, none of the others properly understands a live object environment like Eclipse sufficiently to get it to work as a live environment with M2E and OSGi, and they are top developers, they just haven't been exposed to it due to the prevalence of outdated command line development tools. They only realized it was possible to do so when we were pair programming to solve the configuration problem and I was sharing my screen, causing one of the other team members to exclaim \"that's how you write code so damn fast\", when he saw my code change instantly test itself in the background OSGi container. I can use a bash shell when I have to, such as when I'm looking at logs on a remote server, in fact I do so fairly efficiently precisely so I can get out of that environment as quickly as possible and return to the 21st century."

    "**Answer2:**<br />\n",
    "A Class object is sort of a meta object describing the class of an object. It is used mostly with the reflection capabilities of Java. You can think of it like a \"blueprint\" of the actual class. E.g. you have a class Car like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Car {\n",
    "    public String brand;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can then construct a Class object which describes your \"Car\" class.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Class myCarClass = Class.forName(\"Car\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can do all sorts of querying on your Car class on that Class object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    myCarClass.getName() - returns \"Car\"\n",
    "    myCarClass.getDeclaredField(\"brand\") - returns a Field object describing the \"brand\" field\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. Every java object has a method getClass() which returns the Class object describing the Class of the Java object. So you could do something like:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car myCar = new Car();\n",
    "Class myCarClass  = myCar.getClass();\n",
    "```\n",
    "This also works for objects you don't know, e.g objects you get from the outside:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void tellMeWhatThisObjectsClassIs(Object obj) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(obj.getClass().getName());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could feed this method any java object and it will print the actual class of the object you have given to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with Java, most of the time you don't need to worry about Class objects. They have some handy use cases though. E.g. they allow you to programmatically instanciate objects of a certain class, which is used often for object serialization and deserialization (e.g. converting Java Objects to XML and back, well mostly back).\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Class myCarClass = Class.forName(\"Car\");\n",
    "Car myCar = myCarClass.newInstance();  // is roughly equivalent to = new Car();\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could also use it to find out all declared fields or methods of your class etc, which is very useful in certain cases. So e.g. if your method gets handed an unknown object and you need to know more about it, like if it imlements some interface etc, the Class class is your friend here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So long story short, the Class, Field, Method, etc. classes which are in the java.lang.reflect package allow you to analyze your defined classes, methods, fields, create new instances of them, call methods all kinds of other stuff and they allow you to do this dynamically at runtime. "

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloading generally means that you have two or more functions in the same scope having the same name. The function that better matches the arguments when a call is made wins and is called. Important to note, as opposed to calling a virtual function, is that the function that's called is selected at compile time. It all depends on the static type of the argument. If you have an overload for B and one for D, and the argument is a reference to B, but it really points to a D object, then the overload for B is chosen in C++. That's called static dispatch as opposed to dynamic dispatch. You overload if you want to do the same as another function having the same name, but you want to do that for another argument type. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo const& f) {\n",
    "    // print a foo\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Bar const& bar) {\n",
    "    // print a bar\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "they both print their argument, so they are overloaded. But the first prints a foo, and the second prints a bar. If you have two functions that do different things, it's considered bad style when they have the same name, because that can lead to confusion about what will happen actually when calling the functions. Another usecase for overloading is when you have additional parameters for functions, but they just forward control to other functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo & f, PrintAttributes b) { \n",
    "    /`* ... *`/ \n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo & f, std::string const& header, bool printBold) {\n",
    "    print(f, PrintAttributes(header, printBold));\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be convenient for the caller, if the options that the overloads take are often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding is something completely different. It doesn't compete with overloading. It means that if you have a virtual function in a base class, you can write a function with the same signature in the derived class. The function in the derived class overrides the function of the base. Sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "struct base {\n",
    "    virtual void print() { cout << \"base!\"; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "struct derived: base {\n",
    "    virtual void print() { cout << \"derived!\"; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you have an object and call the print member function, the print function of the derived is always called, because it overrides the one of the base. If the function print wasn't virtual, then the function in the derived wouldn't override the base function, but would merely hide it. Overriding can be useful if you have a function that accepts a base class, and every one that's derived from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "void doit(base &b) {\n",
    "    // and sometimes, we want to print it\n",
    "    b.print();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, even though at compile time the compiler only knows that b is at least base, print of the derived class will be called. That's the point of virtual functions. Without them, the print function of the base would be called, and the one in the derived class wouldn't override it."

    "** Question** <br /> Why the overridden function in class derived has the keyword virtual in front of it? Is it mandatory to put virtual in front of the overriden in the derived class?  Ziezi Sep 28 '15 at 14:20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br /> @Ziezi no, in this example virtual makes no difference but people use it to make it clear that it's actually a virtual function which may be called, e.g., via a reference to the base class. There is a pitfall, if you write virtual void prinf(...){ ...} (typo in the name) you will get a virtual function but of course it isn't connected to base::print and the resulting bug could be subtle. In C++11 the override qualifier was added to explicitly state the override: if you write void prinf(...) override {...} you will get a compile error until you fix the typo. – greggo Oct 20 '16 at 16:51"

    " * Instances of the class [Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html) represent classes and interfaces in a running Java application. An enum is a kind of class and an annotation is a kind of interface. Every array also belongs to a class that is reflected as a Class object that is shared by all arrays with the same element type and number of dimensions. The primitive Java types (boolean, byte, char, short, int, long, float, and double), and the keyword void are also represented as Class objects. \n",
    " * [Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html) has no public constructor. Instead Class objects are constructed automatically by the Java Virtual Machine as classes are loaded and by calls to the defineClass method in the class loader. \n",
    " * The following example uses a Class object to print the class name of an object:\n",
    " \n",
    "```java\n",
    "         void printClassName(Object obj) {\n",
    "             System.out.println(\"The class of \" + obj +\n",
    "                                \" is \" + obj.getClass().getName());\n",
    "         }\n",
    "     \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is also possible to get the Class object for a named type (or for void) using a class literal. See Section 15.8.2 of The Java™ Language Specification. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "    System.out.println(\"The name of class Foo is: \"+Foo.class.getName()); \n",
    "```\n",
    "* From [this source](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/reflect/class/classNew.html): The entry point for all reflection operations is [java.lang.Class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html). With the exception of [java.lang.reflect.ReflectPermission](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/ReflectPermission.html), none of the classes in [java.lang.reflect](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/reflect/package-summary.html) have public constructors. To get to these classes, it is necessary to invoke appropriate methods on Class. **There are several ways to get a Class** depending on whether the code has access to an object, the name of class, a type, or an existing Class.\n",
    "    * Using **Object.getClass()**: If an instance of an object is available, then the simplest way to get its Class is to invoke Object.getClass(). Of course, this only works for reference types which all inherit from Object. \n",
    "    * Using **the .class Syntax**: If the type is available but there is no instance then it is possible to obtain a Class by appending \".class\" to the name of the type. This is also the easiest way to obtain the Class for a primitive type.\n",
    "    * Using **Class.forName()**: If the fully-qualified name of a class is available, it is possible to get the corresponding Class using the static method Class.forName(). This cannot be used for primitive types. The syntax for names of array classes is described by Class.getName(). This syntax is applicable to references and primitive types. Examples: ```Class c = Class.forName(\"com.duke.MyLocaleServiceProvider\");``` or ```Class cDoubleArray = Class.forName(\"[D\");``` or ```Class cStringArray = Class.forName(\"[[Ljava.lang.String;\");```.\n",

    "**What is it?**: An interface is a Java programming language construct, similar to an abstract class, that allows you to specify zero or more method signatures without providing the implementation of those methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why??**<br />\n",
    "The interface is Java's answer to multiple inheritance. It is a Java type that defines what should be done, but not how to do it. Interfaces are perhaps most useful when designing the API for your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let's Get One Thing Straight\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get one thing straight. Right off the bat. There are really two ways that people in Javaland use the term interface. One is conceptual and one is concrete.\n",
    "\n",
    "People sometimes talk about a program's interface, or even a class' interface. Remember that API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface. When used this way, it means the thing with which we interact. It's what is exposed to us that we can work with. It is the visible boundary of a class or a program or a programming language's libraries. This is the conceptual version of the term interface. It means the public (I really mean non-private) methods that we can call to do something.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, an interface is a Java programming language construct, similar to an abstract class, that allows you to specify zero or more method signatures without providing the implementation of those methods. Remember the implementation is the code block that does the work. Let's look at the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**An interface is a contract.** It is binding between the interface and the class that implements the interface.\n",
    "The **class that implements an interface must implement all the methods** (or method signatures) of the interface. It cannot implement only this or that one that it needs. _(kp: In that situation, we may consider using/extending an abstract class that implements the interface, with some implementations just without any code within the braces - for example the WindowAdapter abstract class that implements the WindowListener interface.)_\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why Intefaces (the middleman) - Why not simply define those methods in the class without inheritting from the Interface(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "But **why in the world would you want to do that? A class can implement whatever methods it wants. Why not cut out the middleman, go ahead and implement the methods you want, and then forget about the interface altogether?** Well, you could do that. But **there are actually several reasons why** interfaces are very cool.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If it helps, you can think of an electrical outlet.**\n",
    "\n",
    "An electrical outlet is a wonderful invention. It is really, really a cool thing, the electrical outlet. The interface for every electrical outlet is exactly the same (okay, they're different in the United States than other places, and sometimes you get three little holes to plug stuff into, and sometimes only two; work with me here. Geez). You know that you will be able to use the electricity you need for your laptop, PlayStation, hair drier, or electric dog polisher as long as each of them have standard cords that will plug into an outlet. We could imagine a hypothetical interface called Pluggable that means that it has a standard set of prongs that will plug into a standard outlet. A bowl does not implement the Pluggable interface. Can't plug it in. The book \"The Complete William Shakespeare\" doesn't implement the Pluggable interface. Can't plug it in. However, an e-book reader does implement the Pluggable interface. You could read \"The Complete William Shakespeare\" on e-book or in paper form. Same text. Different implementation.\n",

    "#### Some Reasons Why Interfaces Are Very Cool\n",
    "1. **They encourage smart application design.** Say that you have an application like an e-commerce site. You have to access a database a lot for different reasons. On one occasion, you need to retrieve products and display the catalog; another time, you need to store customer information. Now, these operations aren't related much in terms of the domain. But they do the same thing: interact with the database. You might create an interface called DataAccessor that defines all of the operations that can be done with the database: select, insert, update, delete, and so forth. Then, you have one standard way that all of the programmers on your project can write to. All of your database access contracts, even if written by people working on unrelated parts of the app, will look the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **They promote readability.** I have seen enough people come and go in different jobs that I am a firm believer in doing what you can to make your code readable. Interfaces promote readability because readers of your code know what to expect of a class that implements an interface. Also, it gives readers a second, concise location to overview what the class does.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **They promote maintainability.** The reason that they promote maintainability is more complicated, and we'll get to it in a moment. In a nutshell, if a class implements an interface, you can use the interface type as the reference type of instances of that class. That means that later you can swap out the actual implementation without breaking any of your code. That ability is an instance of polymorphism, one of the pillars of object-oriented programming. More on this in a mo.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **They allow flexibility in your class definitions.** In Java, you are only allowed to explicitly extend, or inherit from, one class. This is different from languages like C++ and C# that allow you to extend multiple classes. By allowing Java classes to extend from one class and also implement an interface at the same time, we can in effect skirt the fact that we're not allowed multiple inheritance, because of polymorphism. In fact, Java programmers are often encouraged to implement an interface instead of inheriting from a class when faced with that choice. Programmers probably come to such a crossroads when creating a new thread. You can create a thread by extending the Thread class or by implementing the Runnable interface. They both get you a thread. But you can implement as many interfaces as you want—you can only inherit from one class. So the idea is to prefer interfaces over inheritance unless you really are extending the definition of what your superclass can do. That is, nine times out of ten we aren't actually extending the functionality of a thread when we write extends Thread. We're not making a more specific, more functional kind of thread; we're just wanting to spawn a new instance of a regular old thread so that we can execute some code separately from the main program thread. In this case, you should implement Runnable and get your thread that way. That leaves you with the ability to extend a different class if you want to, one whose functionality your class is closer to, or that you really need to inherit from.\n"

    "#### How to Write an Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java API is full of terrific interface definitions. One commonly used interface is java.lang.Runnable, which can be implemented to create a thread. To write an interface, you can look at the many good examples in the Java API.\n",
    "\n",
    "When writing your own, you just use the keyword interface instead of class, and then don't include the method implementations. Like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public interface MyInterface {\n",
    "   public void someMethod(long someParam);\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see, you just use the interface keyword in place of class. And then you substitute a semi-colon for the curly braces holding the method implementation. That's all you have to do in a nutshell. In the following sections, we'll see the **many twisting, cavernous corridors that lurk beneath the deceptively simple interface**.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you have an interface, you implement it. That means you declare a class that implements the interface, and then write the implementation for each method in the interface. And the method signatures must match exactly. Like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public MyClass implements MyInterface {\n",
    "  //since I said \"implements MyInterface\",    //I must include this method, or\n",
    "  //this class won't compile\n",
    "  public void someMethod(long someParam) {\n",
    "    //this is my implementation.\n",

    "### Interfaces Versus Abstract Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "There are differences between an interface and an abstract class, though commonly the two are confused. Why do you need an interface? When should I use an interface and when an abstract class? Let's let the two duke it out for themselves, and you decide.\n",
    "#### Monsters fight!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round One:** An interface is a totally abstract class. In an abstract class, you can define some methods that are abstract, and some methods that are fully implemented. Any class that extends that abstract class must implement the abstract methods, but it inherits the functionality as implemented in the abstract class. This is very cool if you need that kind of structure in your program, but can make your API a little snaky.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Round Two:** In an interface, there can be no implementation whatsoever. You can say this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    List starWarsFigures = new ArrayList(500);\n",
    "\n",

    "    List starWarsFigures = new Vector();\n",
    "\n",
    "This is very cool if you need that kind of flexibility, which is often a good thing.\n",

   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Rules for Writing an Interface\n",
    "* Declare an interface using the keyword interface.\n",
    "* An interface may extend zero or more interfaces if it likes, but it cannot extend a class, because then it would inherit functionality, and interfaces cannot have functionality. They can only talk about it.\n",
    "* Interface methods cannot be static.\n",
    "* Interface methods are implicitly abstract. For that reason, you cannot mark them final (duh), synchronized, or native because all of these modifiers tell how you're going to implement the method, and you're voluntarily giving up that ability when you write the method in an interface.\n",
    "* strictfp is okay on an interface. It is okay because you can evaluate compile-time constants using strictfp rules within an interface.\n",
    "* All interface methods are implicitly abstract and public, regardless of what you write in the interface definition! It is true. The interface method declaration void biteIt(int times), despite its apparent access level of default, actually has public access. Try it. If you write a class in another package beyond the visibility of default access, and include the seemingly legal implementation of void biteIt(int times) { ; }, the compiler will tell you that you cannot reduce the visibility of the method from public to default. They're all abstract; they're all public.\n",
    "* An interface can define variables. But all variables defined in an interface must be declared public, static, and final. Many Java programmers have adopted the practice of defining only variables within an interface and putting constants in it. This works to get at shared constants, but it is a workaround and is no longer necessary if you're using J2SE SDK 5.0. It features a new static import facility that allows you to import constants just as you would a class or package.\n",
    "* It should be obvious by now that an interface cannot implement another interface or a class.\n",
    "* You may modify your methods using the keyword abstract if you like, but it will have no effect on compilation. Methods in an interface are already abstract, and the Java Language Specification says that its use in interfaces is obsolete.\n",
    "* Likewise, the interface itself is already abstract. So you can do this if you want: public abstract interface Chompable {}. But there's no point; it's redundant.\n",
    "* Interfaces have default access by default (!). So this is legal: interface Chompable { }. But if you want your interface to have public access, use that modifier in the interface declaration.\n",
    "* You cannot declare an interface as having private access. It doesn't make any sense. No one could implement it. So private interface Chompable { } gets you a compiler error for your trouble.\n",
    "* public, static, and final are implicit on all field declarations in an interface.\n",
    "\n",

    "The Worker interface defines an object that performs some work on one or more background threads. The state of the Worker object is observable and usable from the JavaFX Application thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifecycle of the Worker object is defined as follows. When created, the Worker object is in the READY state. Upon being scheduled for work, the Worker object transitions to the SCHEDULED state. After that, when the Worker object is performing the work, its state becomes RUNNING. Note that even when the Worker object is immediately started without being scheduled, it first transitions to the SCHEDULED state and then to the RUNNING state. The state of a Worker object that completes successfully is SUCCEEDED, and the value property is set to the result of this Worker object. Otherwise, if any exceptions are thrown during the execution of the Worker object, its state becomes FAILED and the exception property is set to the type of the exception that occurred. At any time before the end of the Worker object the developer can interrupt it by invoking the cancel method, which puts the Worker object into the CANCELLED state.\n",

    "The progress of the work being done by the Worker object can be obtained through three different properties such as totalWork, workDone, and progress.\n",

    "Tasks are used to implement the logic of work that needs to be done on a background thread. First, you need to extend the Task class. Your implementation of the Task class must override the call method to do the background work and return the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The call method is invoked on the background thread, therefore this method can only manipulate states that are safe to read and write from a background thread. For example, manipulating an active scene graph from the call method throws runtime exceptions. On the other hand, the Task class is designed to be used with JavaFX GUI applications, and it ensures that any changes to public properties, change notifications for errors or cancellation, event handlers, and states occur on the JavaFX Application thread. Inside the call method, you can use the updateProgress, updateMessage, updateTitle methods, which update the values of the corresponding properties on the JavaFX Application thread. However, if the task was canceled, a return value from the call method is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Task class fits into the Java concurrency libraries because it inherits from the java.utils.concurrent.FutureTask class, which implements the Runnable interface. For this reason, a Task object can be used within the Java concurrency Executor API and also can be passed to a thread as a parameter. You can call the Task object directly by using the FutureTask.run() method, which enables calling this task from another background thread. Having a good understanding of the Java concurrency API will help you understand concurrency in JavaFX."

In the Hotspot JVM there is a direct mapping between a Java Thread and a native operating system Thread. After preparing all of the state for a Java thread such as thread-local storage, allocation buffers, synchronization objects, stacks and the program counter, the native thread is created. The native thread is reclaimed once the Java thread terminates. The operating system is therefore responsible for scheduling all threads and dispatching them to any available CPU. Once the native thread has initialized it invokes the run() method in the Java thread. When the run() method returns, uncaught exceptions are handled, then the native thread confirms if the JVM needs to be terminated as a result of the thread terminating (i.e. is it the last non-deamon thread). When the thread terminates all resources for both the native and Java thread are released.\n",

    "#### Four types of JDBC Drivers Available\n",
    "\n",
    "JDBC Drivers implement the defined interfaces in the JDBC API, for interacting with your database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using JDBC drivers enable you to open database connections and interact with it by sending SQL or Database commands, then receiving the results with java.\n",
    "\n",
    "The java.sql package (see java documentation available at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ and **java.sql** link on the top left panel, under **Packages**.)) that ships with JDK, contains various classes and interfaces with their behaviours defined and their actual implementations are done in third-party drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third party vendors implement the java.sql.driver interface in their database driver. For example, previously, we downloaded the MySQL databse driver from the vendor MySQL to use with the MySQL database server(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The four types of the JDBC drivers are:**\n",
    "* **JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver**\n",
    "    * Used to connect to or access the ODBC driver installed on each client machine. \n",
    "    * Requires configurations. \n",
    "    * Used with old java versions (because most databases in the past supported only ODBC access) or only for experimental purposes.\n",
    "* **JDBC-Native API**\n",
    "    * The JDBC API calls are converted into native C/C++ API calls, which is unique to the database. \n",
    "    * Typically provided by the database. \n",
    "    * Rendered and used in the same manner as the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.\n",
    "    * Must be installed on each client machine\n",
    "    * If you change the database, you have to change the native API as well, as it is specific to database.\n",
    "    * Better speed because it eliminates the ODBC overhead.\n",
    "    * An example - the **Oracle Call Interface (OCI)** driver \n",
    "* **JDBC-NET PURE JAVA** \n",
    "    * Three types of approaches (or 'Tree type approach??) used to access the database.\n",
    "        * JDBC client uses standard network socket to communicate with a middleware application server. The socket information is then translated by a middleware application server into a call format required by DBMS and forwarded to database server.\n",
    "        * This kind of driver is extremely flexible since it requires no code installed on the client and a single driver can actually provide access to multiple databases.\n",
    "        * You think of applications server as a JDBC proxy meaning it makes calls from the client applicaiton as a result and you need some knowledge of application server configuration in order to effectively use this type of drivers.\n",
    "* **100% Pure Java Based Drivers**   \n",
    "    * These drivers communicate directly with the vendor database through a socket connection. \n",
    "    * These are the highest performace drivers available and are usually provided by the vendor itself. \n",
    "    * Example the Java drivers downloaded (see above) from the mysql.com intended for use with their own DBMS i.e. the MySQL server."

    "### Annotations Basics\n",
    "#### The Format of an Annotation\n",
    "\n",
    "In its simplest form, an annotation looks like the following:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Entity\n",
    "```\n",
    "The at sign character (@) indicates to the compiler that what follows is an annotation. In the following example, the annotation's name is Override:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Override\n",
    "void mySuperMethod() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "The annotation can include elements, which can be named or unnamed, and there are values for those elements:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Author(\n",
    "   name = \"Benjamin Franklin\",\n",
    "   date = \"3/27/2003\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "class MyClass() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "or\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@SuppressWarnings(value = \"unchecked\")\n",
    "void myMethod() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "If there is just one element named value, then the name can be omitted, as in:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@SuppressWarnings(\"unchecked\")\n",
    "void myMethod() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the annotation has no elements, then the parentheses can be omitted, as shown in the previous @Override example.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to use multiple annotations on the same declaration:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Author(name = \"Jane Doe\")\n",
    "@EBook\n",
    "class MyClass { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "If the annotations have the same type, then this is called a [repeating annotation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/repeating.html):\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Author(name = \"Jane Doe\")\n",
    "@Author(name = \"John Smith\")\n",
    "class MyClass { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "Repeating annotations are supported as of the Java SE 8 release. For more information, see Repeating Annotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation type can be one of the types that are defined in the **java.lang** or **java.lang.annotation** packages of the Java SE API. In the previous examples, **Override and SuppressWarnings are [predefined Java annotations](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/predefined.html)**.

    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The annotation type definition looks similar to an interface definition where the keyword interface is preceded by the at sign (@) (@ = AT, as in annotation type). Annotation types are a form of interface, which will be covered in a later lesson. For the moment, you do not need to understand interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The body of the previous annotation definition contains annotation type element declarations, which look a lot like methods. Note that they can define optional default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the annotation type is defined, you can use annotations of that type, with the values filled in, like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@ClassPreamble (\n",
    "   author = \"John Doe\",\n",
    "   date = \"3/17/2002\",\n",
    "   currentRevision = 6,\n",

    " * RetentionPolicy.SOURCE – The marked annotation is retained only in the source level and is ignored by the compiler.\n",
    " * RetentionPolicy.CLASS – The marked annotation is retained by the compiler at compile time, but is ignored by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).\n",
    " * RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME – The marked annotation is retained by the JVM so it can be used by the runtime environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Documented** @Documented annotation indicates that whenever the specified annotation is used those elements should be documented using the Javadoc tool. (By default, annotations are not included in Javadoc.) For more information, see the Javadoc tools page.\n",
    "\n",
    "**@Target** @Target annotation marks another annotation to restrict what kind of Java elements the annotation can be applied to. A target annotation specifies one of the following element types as its value:\n",
    "\n",
    " * ElementType.ANNOTATION_TYPE can be applied to an annotation type.\n",
    " * ElementType.CONSTRUCTOR can be applied to a constructor.\n",
    " * ElementType.FIELD can be applied to a field or property.\n",
    " * ElementType.LOCAL_VARIABLE can be applied to a local variable.\n",
    " * ElementType.METHOD can be applied to a method-level annotation.\n",
    " * ElementType.PACKAGE can be applied to a package declaration.\n",
    " * ElementType.PARAMETER can be applied to the parameters of a method.\n",

When the user queries the annotation type and the class has no annotation for this type, the class' superclass is queried for the annotation type. This annotation applies only to class declarations.\n",

    "### Type Annotations and Pluggable Type Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the Java SE 8 release, annotations could only be applied to declarations. As of the Java SE 8 release, annotations can also be applied to any type use. This means that annotations can be used anywhere you use a type. A few examples of where types are used are class instance creation expressions (new), casts, implements clauses, and throws clauses. This form of annotation is called a type annotation and several examples are provided in Annotations Basics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type annotations were created to support improved analysis of Java programs way of ensuring stronger type checking. The Java SE 8 release does not provide a type checking framework, but it allows you to write (or download) a type checking framework that is implemented as one or more pluggable modules that are used in conjunction with the Java compiler.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you want to ensure that a particular variable in your program is never assigned to null; you want to avoid triggering a NullPointerException. You can write a custom plug-in to check for this. You would then modify your code to annotate that particular variable, indicating that it is never assigned to null. The variable declaration might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "@NonNull String str;\n",
    "\n",
    "When you compile the code, including the NonNull module at the command line, the compiler prints a warning if it detects a potential problem, allowing you to modify the code to avoid the error. After you correct the code to remove all warnings, this particular error will not occur when the program runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use multiple type-checking modules where each module checks for a different kind of error. In this way, you can build on top of the Java type system, adding specific checks when and where you want them.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the judicious use of type annotations and the presence of pluggable type checkers, you can write code that is stronger and less prone to error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, you do not have to write your own type checking modules. There are third parties who have done the work for you. For example, you might want to take advantage of the Checker Framework created by the University of Washington. This framework includes a NonNull module, as well as a regular expression module, and a mutex lock module. For more information, see the Checker Framework."

    "### Repeating Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some situations where you want to apply the same annotation to a declaration or type use. As of the Java SE 8 release, repeating annotations enable you to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you are writing code to use a timer service that enables you to run a method at a given time or on a certain schedule, similar to the UNIX cron service. Now you want to set a timer to run a method, doPeriodicCleanup, on the last day of the month and on every Friday at 11:00 p.m. To set the timer to run, create an @Schedule annotation and apply it twice to the doPeriodicCleanup method. The first use specifies the last day of the month and the second specifies Friday at 11p.m., as shown in the following code example:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Schedule(dayOfMonth=\"last\")\n",
    "@Schedule(dayOfWeek=\"Fri\", hour=\"23\")\n",
    "public void doPeriodicCleanup() { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "The previous example applies an annotation to a method. You can repeat an annotation anywhere that you would use a standard annotation. For example, you have a class for handling unauthorized access exceptions. You annotate the class with one @Alert annotation for managers and another for admins:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "@Alert(role=\"Manager\")\n",
    "@Alert(role=\"Administrator\")\n",
    "public class UnauthorizedAccessException extends SecurityException { ... }\n",
    "```\n",
    "For compatibility reasons, repeating annotations are stored in a container annotation that is automatically generated by the Java compiler. In order for the compiler to do this, two declarations are required in your code.\n",
    "Step 1: Declare a Repeatable Annotation Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The annotation type must be marked with the @Repeatable meta-annotation. The following example defines a custom @Schedule repeatable annotation type:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "import java.lang.annotation.Repeatable;\n",
    "\n",
    "@Repeatable(Schedules.class)\n",
    "public @interface Schedule {\n",
    "  String dayOfMonth() default \"first\";\n",
    "  String dayOfWeek() default \"Mon\";\n",
    "  int hour() default 12;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The value of the @Repeatable meta-annotation, in parentheses, is the type of the container annotation that the Java compiler generates to store repeating annotations. In this example, the containing annotation type is Schedules, so repeating @Schedule annotations is stored in an @Schedules annotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying the same annotation to a declaration without first declaring it to be repeatable results in a compile-time error.\n",
    "Step 2: Declare the Containing Annotation Type\n",
    "\n",
    "The containing annotation type must have a value element with an array type. The component type of the array type must be the repeatable annotation type. The declaration for the Schedules containing annotation type is the following:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public @interface Schedules {\n",
    "    Schedule[] value();\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Retrieving Annotations\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods available in the Reflection API that can be used to retrieve annotations. The behavior of the methods that return a single annotation, such as AnnotatedElement.getAnnotation(Class<T>), are unchanged in that they only return a single annotation if one annotation of the requested type is present. If more than one annotation of the requested type is present, you can obtain them by first getting their container annotation. In this way, legacy code continues to work. Other methods were introduced in Java SE 8 that scan through the container annotation to return multiple annotations at once, such as AnnotatedElement.getAnnotationsByType(Class<T>). See the AnnotatedElement class specification for information on all of the available methods.\n",
    "Design Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing an annotation type, you must consider the cardinality of annotations of that type. It is now possible to use an annotation zero times, once, or, if the annotation's type is marked as @Repeatable, more than once. It is also possible to restrict where an annotation type can be used by using the @Target meta-annotation. For example, you can create a repeatable annotation type that can only be used on methods and fields. It is important to design your annotation type carefully to ensure that the programmer using the annotation finds it to be as flexible and powerful as possible."

    "The Oracle Certification Program certifies candidates on skills and knowledge related to Oracle products and technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Credentials are granted based on a combination of passing exams, training and performance-based assignments, depending on the level of certification. Oracle certifications are tangible benchmarks of experience and expertise that help you stand out in a crowd among employers.[according to whom?]\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 6 levels of Oracle Certification credentials: Oracle Certified Junior Associate (OJA), Oracle Certified Associate (OCA), Oracle Certified Professional (OCP), Oracle Certified Master (OCM), Oracle Certified Expert (OCE) and Oracle Certified Specialist (OCS). These credentials are spread across 9 technology pillars and further broken down into product family and product groupings. Certifications are also defined by job role on the Oracle Certification website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oracle Certified Junior Associate (OJA) credential is a novice-level certification focused on students in secondary schools, two-year colleges and four year colleges and universities and faculty members who teach foundational Java and computer science classes.[1]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oracle Certified Associate (OCA) credential is the first step toward achieving an Oracle Certified Professional certification. The OCA credential ensures a candidate is equipped with fundamental skills, providing a strong foundation for supporting Oracle products.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oracle Certified Professional (OCP) credential builds upon the fundamental skills demonstrated by the OCA. The Oracle Certified Professional has a command of a specific area of Oracle technology and demonstrates a high level of knowledge and skills. IT managers often use the OCP credential to evaluate the qualifications of employees and job candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oracle Certified Master (OCM) credential recognizes the highest level of demonstrated skills, knowledge and proven abilities. OCMs are equipped to answer the most difficult questions and solve the most complex problems. The Oracle Certified Master certification validates a candidate's abilities through passing rigorous performance-based exams. The certification typically builds upon the fundamental skills of the OCA and the more advanced skills of the OCP.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oracle Certified Expert (OCE) credentials recognize competency in specific, niche oriented technologies, architectures or domains. Credentials are independent of the traditional OCA, OCP, OCM hierarchy, but often build upon skills proven as an OCA or OCP. Competencies falling under the umbrella of the Expert program range from foundational skills to mastery of advanced technologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Oracle Certified Specialist (OCS) credentials are typically implementation-oriented certifications targeting employees of current Oracle partners, though the certifications are available to all candidates, partner or not. These certifications are built on very focused products or skillsets and provide a solid measure of a candidate's level of expertise in a particular area.\n"
