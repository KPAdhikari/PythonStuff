    "### Scene Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaFX scene graph, shown as part of the top layer in Figure 1, is the starting point for constructing a JavaFX application. It is a hierarchical tree of nodes that represents all of the visual elements of the application's user interface. It can handle input and can be rendered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A single element in a scene graph is called a node. Each node has an ID, style class, and bounding volume. With the exception of the root node of a scene graph, each node in a scene graph has a single parent and zero or more children. It can also have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Effects, such as blurs and shadows\n",
    "\n",
    " * Opacity\n",
    "\n",
    " * Transforms\n",
    "\n",
    " * Event handlers (such as mouse, key and input method)\n",
    "\n",
    " * An application-specific state\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike in Swing and Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), the JavaFX scene graph also includes the graphics primitives, such as rectangles and text, in addition to having controls, layout containers, images and media.\n",
    "\n",
    "For most uses, the scene graph simplifies working with UIs, especially when rich UIs are used. Animating various graphics in the scene graph can be accomplished quickly using the javafx.animation APIs, and declarative methods, such as XML doc, also work well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The _javafx.scene_ API allows the creation and specification of several types of content, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Nodes:** Shapes (2-D and 3-D), images, media, embedded web browser, text, UI controls, charts, groups, and containers\n",
    " * **State:** Transforms (positioning and orientation of nodes), visual effects, and other visual state of the content\n",
    " * **Effects:** Simple objects that change the appearance of scene graph nodes, such as blurs, shadows, and color adjustment\n",

    "### Java Public APIs for JavaFX Features\n",
    "\n",
    "The top layer of the JavaFX architecture shown in Figure 1 provides a complete set of public APIs that support rich client application development. These APIs provide unparalleled freedom and flexibility to construct rich client applications. The JavaFX platform combines the best capabilities of the Java platform with comprehensive, immersive media functionality into an intuitive and comprehensive one-stop development environment. These new Java APIs for JavaFX features:\n",
    "\n",
    " * Allow the use of powerful Java features, such as generics, annotations, and multithreading.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Make it easier for Web developers to use JavaFX from other JVM-based dynamic languages, such as Groovy, and JavaScript.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Allow Java developers to use other system languages, such as Groovy, for writing large or complex JavaFX applications.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Allow the use of binding which includes support for the high performance lazy binding, binding expressions, bound sequence expressions, and partial bind reevaluation. Alternative languages (like Groovy) can use this binding library to introduce binding syntax similar to that of JavaFX Script.\n",
    "\n",
    " * Extend the Java collections library to include observable lists and maps, which allow applications to wire user interfaces to data models, observe changes in those data models, and update the corresponding UI control accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaFX APIs and programming model are a continuation of the JavaFX 1.x product line. Most of the JavaFX APIs have been ported directly to Java. Some APIs, such as Layout and Media, along with many other details, have been improved and simplified based on feedback received from users of the JavaFX 1.x release. JavaFX relies more on web standards, such as CSS for styling controls and ARIA for accessibility specifications. The use of additional web standards is also under review."

It provides software rendering when the graphics hardware on a system is insufficient to support hardware accelerated rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two graphics accelerated pipelines are implemented on the JavaFX platform:\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Prism** processes render jobs. It can run on both hardware and software renderers, including 3-D. It is responsible for rasterization and rendering of JavaFX scenes. The following multiple render paths are possible based on the device being used:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * DirectX 9 on Windows XP and Windows Vista\n",
    "\n",

    "    * Java2D when hardware acceleration is not possible\n",

    "    * The fully hardware accelerated path is used when possible, but when it is not available, the Java2D render path is used because the Java2D render path is already distributed in all of the Java Runtime Environments (JREs). This is particularly important when handling 3-D scenes. However, performance is better when the hardware render paths are used.\n",
    "\n",
    " * **Quantum Toolkit** ties Prism and Glass Windowing Toolkit together and makes them available to the JavaFX layer above them in the stack. It also manages the threading rules related to rendering versus events handling."

    "### Glass Windowing Toolkit\n",

    "The Glass Windowing Toolkit, shown in beige in the middle portion of Figure 1, is the lowest level in the JavaFX graphics stack. Its main responsibility is to provide native operating services, such as managing the windows, timers, and surfaces. It serves as the platform-dependent layer that connects the JavaFX platform to the native operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Glass toolkit is also responsible for managing the event queue. Unlike the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT), which manages its own event queue, the Glass toolkit uses the native operating system's event queue functionality to schedule thread usage. Also unlike AWT, the Glass toolkit runs on the same thread as the JavaFX application. In AWT, the native half of AWT runs on one thread and the Java level runs on another thread. This introduces a lot of issues, many of which are resolved in JavaFX by using the single JavaFX application thread approach.\n",
    "Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "The system runs two or more of the following threads at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **JavaFX application thread:** This is the primary thread used by JavaFX application developers. Any “live” scene, which is a scene that is part of a window, must be accessed from this thread. A scene graph can be created and manipulated in a background thread, but when its root node is attached to any live object in the scene, that scene graph must be accessed from the JavaFX application thread. This enables developers to create complex scene graphs on a background thread while keeping animations on 'live' scenes smooth and fast. The JavaFX application thread is a different thread from the Swing and AWT Event Dispatch Thread (EDT), so care must be taken when embedding JavaFX code into Swing applications.\n",
    "* **Prism render thread:** This thread handles the rendering separately from the event dispatcher. It allows frame N to be rendered while frame N +1 is being processed. This ability to perform concurrent processing is a big advantage, especially on modern systems that have multiple processors. The Prism render thread may also have multiple rasterization threads that help off-load work that needs to be done in rendering.\n",

    "### Pulse\n",
    "\n",
    "A pulse is an event that indicates to the JavaFX scene graph that it is time to synchronize the state of the elements on the scene graph with Prism. A pulse is throttled at 60 frames per second (fps) maximum and is fired whenever animations are running on the scene graph. Even when animation is not running, a pulse is scheduled when something in the scene graph is changed. For example, if a position of a button is changed, a pulse is scheduled.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a pulse is fired, the state of the elements on the scene graph is synchronized down to the rendering layer. A pulse enables application developers a way to handle events asynchronously. This important feature allows the system to batch and execute events on the pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "Layout and CSS are also tied to pulse events. Numerous changes in the scene graph could lead to multiple layout or CSS updates, which could seriously degrade performance. The system automatically performs a CSS and layout pass once per pulse to avoid performance degradation. Application developers can also manually trigger layout passes as needed to take measurements prior to a pulse.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Glass Windowing Toolkit is responsible for executing the pulse events. It uses the high-resolution native timers to make the execution."
