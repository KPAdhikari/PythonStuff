    "    * [DC_GUI class - Defining, Initializing (Adding Event-Action-Listeners and Event-Action-Tasks etc) and Displaying the GUI](#DC_GUI_Class) - An **Event-Action-Task** (the action/work/task to be performed) is defined inside the **actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae)** method of the **Event-Handler-Class** that we write by implementing the **ActionListener** inteface (which has actionPerformed as it's only method). An instance of this handler class is then passed to the **addActionListener** method of the given component (button, text field etc) on which the action (such as button-click or text-typing etc) is supposed/expected to occur. [This Oracle documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/events/actionlistener.html) refers to this as **registering the (event-handler as a) listener** to the corresponding GUI component.\n",
    "    * Immediately after opening the main GUI, we call the method  **[launchThreadsToRedirectStdOutAndStdErr()](#launchThreadsToRedirectStdOutAndStdErr)** of the same class, we start the two daemon threads 'reader' and 'reader2' that redirect the Std.out and Std.err onto the text area of the GUI. The threads use **PipedInputStream** and **PipedOutputStream** to accomplish that task.\n",
    "        * Please note that when the **start()** method of each of these two threads is invoked, the **[run()](#runMethod)** method is executed in each of the two threads and as you can see from the run() method, the corresponding 'while' loop will be running that takes care of constantly receiving the redirected byte-streams (piped-streams) and then parsing and printing them onto the textArea of the GUI. These loops will end only when the value of the 'quit' flips to 'true' which happens inside **[public synchronized void windowClosed](#windowClosed)(WindowEvent evt)** (invoked when the main GUI window is closed).\n",
    "        * Initially, I mistakenly thought that I could also put the following method call at the top of this constructor, well before the GUI is opened, but I realized, that doesn't make sense, because we want these threads to redirect the outputs to the text are in the GUI that we open. If we don't have that GUI defined already, these threads wont know where to output. I tried that but it didn't produce the intended behaviour/result, although the program didn't seem to crash."

These two threads are start()ed immediately after the main GUI is made visible (displayed), which means the 'run()' method (the implemented method of the Runnable interface) of this object will be executed by both of these threads.\n",
    "    * Please note that the passing of 'this' means, the reference to the same GUI object of type DC_GUI (not two different objects of the same type) is passed to these threads, thus the two threads will be interacting with the same object concurrently. For example, in our case, the 'this' reference is equivalent to 'mk'. \n",
    "        * So, it is important to remember that the window we open is a JFrame object member of bigger object 'mk' and the reference to that same object is what is passed to the two piped-stream threads.\n",

    "#### So, why do we extend WindowAdapter or Implement  WindowListener, ActionListener, Runnable?\n",
    "* <font color='red'>First off, why extend **WindowAdapter** abstract class?</font>\n",
    "    - The **windowClosed(..), windowClosing(..)** etc are some of the (synchronized) methods of the WindowListener interface. We don't have to implement all the methods of this interface here because this class also extends WindowAdapter which is an abstract adapter class for receiving window events. The methods in this abstract class are empty and the class exists as convenience for creating listener objects. \n",
    "        - If you implement the WindowListener interface, you have to define all of the    methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.\n",
    "        - see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/WindowListener.html and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/WindowAdapter.html The latter webpage says the following about WindowAdapter abstract class:\n",
    "            - Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a Window (frame in our case) using the window's addWindowListener method (for example see the line 'frame.addWindowListener(this)' above. When the window's status changes by virtue of being opened, closed, activated or deactivated, iconified or deiconified, the relevant method in the listener object ('this' object in this/our case) is invoked, and the WindowEvent is passed to it.\n",
    "    - If we don't use the WindowAdapter and only depend on JFrame, we can still make it exit on closing of the window by invoking the following line **frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);**, but we cannot make it do anything more when it is ready to close or when it is closed already. With the extension of the WindowAdapter abstract class, now we can add any functionality we want putting the corresponding code inside the methods **windowClosed(..), windowClosing(..)**. For example, inside the synchronzed **windowClosed(WindowEvent ev)** method of the current DC_GUI case, we put code for invoking the 'join()' methods on the two **redirection** threads 'reader' and 'reader2'and also for closing the pipedStream objects 'pin' and 'pin2'. Likewise, inside the synchronized method **windowClosing(WindowEvent ev)** we put only two lines as follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "        frame.setVisible(false); // default behaviour of JFrame\n",
    "        frame.dispose();\n",
    "```"

    "* <font color='red'>Next, why implement the **WindowListener** interface?</font> Isn't it superfluous to implement it if we are also extending the WindowAdapter?\n",
    "    * I think that indeed seems to be the case. I mean the implementation of WindowListener is superfluous indeed. I simply removed the WindowListener from the class declaration and executed the program and it still ran as before with no difference or side effects.\n",
    "* <font color='red'>Next, why implement the **ActionListener** interface?</font> Is it also avoidable?\n",
    "    * Because of the implementation of this interface, we have the method **public synchronized void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) ** implemented but it seems not much is done inside this method. So, may be we could live without implementing this interface. I need to think more about it.\n",
    "* <font color='red'>Next, why implement the **Runnable** interface?</font> Is it also avoidable?  <a id='implementsRunnable'></a> \n",
    "    * The overriden **run()** method is associated with the Runnable and the method is executed when the **start()** method is invoked on the thread which was created by passing the **this** object. In our case we create two such threads 'reader' and 'reader2' which do the grunt work of redirecting the standard outputs and errors to our own text area.\n",
    "        * And, inside the [run()](#runMethod) method we have two identical if-blocks - one for thread 'reader' and another for 'reader2' - that takes care of how to process and where to display the redirected standard outputs and errors. The 'reader' redirects standard-output with the help of PipedInputStream object 'pin' and 'reader2' redirects standard-errors using 'pin2'. Please note that these two threads run in the background because they are made 'daemon' threads in the beginning by invoking their methods 'setDaemon(true)' (which is done just before the start() method is called)."

    "\n",
    "CountDownLatch is used to make sure that a task waits for other threads before it \n",

    "can only start when all the required services have started.\n",

    "CountDownLatch.countDown() once they are completed or ready to the job. As soon as \n",

    "* The thread, which is dependent on other threads to start processing, waits on until every other thread has called count down. All threads, which are waiting on await() proceed together once count down reaches to zero.\n",

    " Multi-Core Programming with Java<br />\n",
    "December 29, 2014<br />\n",
    "Processors speeds are no longer growing at the rate we've grown accustomed to. \n",
    "Moore's law states that computers double in speed every 18 months. Moore's law is \n",
    "still alive and well, but we just need to find alternate ways to speed up computers.\n",
    "That's where multi-core programming comes into play. The idea behind it is that 2 \n",
    "heads are better than one and in the right situation 2 processors can work on the \n",
    "same problem to solve it twice as fast. Parallel programming is becoming increasingly \n",
    "important these days and there are many different flavors of it including distributed \n",
    "computing, shared memory computing, and GPU computing. Today I am going to focus on \n",
    "shared memory computing, or using multi-core computers rather than many single core \n",
    "computers. This blog post is intended to serve as a beginners guide to parallel \n",
    "programming with Java. It is recommended that the reader have some java experience \n",
    "and is familiar with some of the features of Java 8 (namely lambda expressions and \n",
    "streams). Most modern day computers are multi-core and 4 cores is the norm from what \n",
    "I've seen, but depending on your computer you may have more or less.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "I will demonstrate multi-core programming with java by means of example. For \n",
    "simplicity and demonstration purposes, I am going to use the Monte Carlo method for \n",
    "approximating Pi. If you are unfamiliar with the algorithm, I created an animation \n",
    "to demonstrate how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "... Animated Picture ...\n",
    "... The animated picture shows dots/points thrown randomly onto a square box (in \n",
    "..  of side length = 1), in the first quadrant of the coordinate space. The dots\n",
    "..  which have sqrt(x2 + y2) <= 1 is given green color and the rest is given 'red'.\n",
    "... These colored dots gradually fill up both the reasons and we want to calculate\n",
    "... the ratio of the numbers of the dots in the two areas, which should be equal to \n",
    "..   pi/4.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Note that you can restart the animation by pressing the Space Bar. The algorithm \n",
    "works by taking a random sample of points from a uniform distribution with 0<x,y<1 \n",
    "and determining if that point lies within the first quadrant of the unit circle \n",
    "centered at (0,0). If it does, then that is considered a success. If the random number \n",
    "generator is truly uniform, then success/total≈π/4, since the area of the first quadrant \n",
    "of the unit circle is π/4 and the total area of the unit cube is 1.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Java Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java Runnable interface is designed for handling parallel and concurrent programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "There are a few things to note about this implementation. First, the information about \n",
    "what is being computed is being passed in to the constructor. In this case, that is \n",
    "just the number of trials to compute. Second, the CountDownLatch is a java class in \n",
    "the java.util.concurrent package. It is a mechanism to safely handle counting the \n",
    "number of completed tasks. You should call latch.countDown() whenever the run method \n",
    "competes.\n",
    "\n",
    " So now we have a Runnable class that can handle a single set of trials. Now, I want \n",
    "to create multiple instances of this Runnable and let my quad-core computer quadruple \n",
    "the performance! The ExecutorService is exactly what we need to accomplish this. \n",
    "\n",
    "The ExecutorService class enables you to easily run and execute Runnables (and Callables). \n",
    "It is created with the Executors.newFixedThreadPool(threads) method. The input argument \n",
    "is the number of threads you want in your pool. I typically like to choose this number \n",
    "to be twice as many cores on my computer, but depending on the situation you might want \n",
    "to do something different. If you expect each job to take the same amount of time, then \n",
    "it's a good idea to make this a multiple of the number of cores on your computer. If the \n",
    "amount of time for each job varies based on the input, then it's a good idea to set this \n",
    "value to be larger so that 1 job wont be a major bottleneck. Next, you need to instantiate \n",
    "a CountDownLatch with the same number of jobs as before. Next, you need to create the jobs; \n",
    "I store them in an array so I can collect the results at the end. If your runnable just \n",
    "updates a global variable, then it's not necessary to store these runnables objects. \n",
    "exec.execute(r) adds r to the thread pool. After all the runnables have been added to \n",
    "the pool, you need to call latch.await() which blocks until the latch reaches 0 (indicating\n",
    "all the compute units finished computing). Then, it's safe to shutdown the ExecutorService \n",
    "and collect the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "The above code should provide a minimal working parallel program for you to play around \n",
    "with. You can tinker with the existing code or implement your own Runnable class and try \n",
    "it out for yourself. You'll need to have Java 8 installed but other than that it should \n",
    "be good to go!"

    "We are going to start with a simple example. Anyone who has done threading in java is familiar with the Runnable interface, which can be given to a Thread to run the code within the run method on a separate thread. Let's take a look at the old way to do this and the new way. The first variable r1 is an instance of a Runnable interface done the old way, the second variable r2 is how you do it with lambda expressions.\n",
