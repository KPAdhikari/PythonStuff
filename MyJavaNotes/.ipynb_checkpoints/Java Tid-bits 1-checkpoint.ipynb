    "Maven strikes me as a case of something written by a bunch of past-their-sell-by-date c-shell script kiddies who think autoconf is leading edge code automation and don't understand that object code requires an object environment to be in any way efficient either for development or deployment. Ant was bad enough, but Maven combines all the worst features of Ant and Ivy. It doesn't create an object environment, and it doesn't play well with tools that do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply, an object environment should have all class objects, i.e. the objects that determine the types of objects available to the system, live and available at all times. From there I can do whatever I want, instantiate multiple objects of a class, set up various sequences and instantiation rules, etc. Since the environment should be completely live, I shouldn't need a build tool at all. In terms of deploying my app, it's not difficult for the environment to simply throw out all the class objects that are never referenced by code in the namespaces that make up my app. The garbage collector in the JVM does almost the same thing on the fly today. At that point I have a deployment environment made up of my objects and all the objects (primarily class objects) that my objects reference, i.e. my application and all dependencies. This is how virtual machines work. (that our VMs are so poorly written we need to run a Spring VM on a Java VM on a Linux VM on a VMWare VM on another Linux VM is another example of the idiocy of software development). When dependencies get updated, it's simple enough for the environment to prompt the developer to merge his old code to the new libs, merge the code using the new libs down to the older version, or keep both versions. Prompting encourages the developer to make the slight modifications that are sometimes necessary to avoid having twenty versions of every library, while tools like Maven hide the fact that you have twenty versions and result in the massive runtime bloat common in Java apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Java development space Eclipse comes closest to being a proper object environment, although granted there are plenty of plugins that break the paradigm in various ways. Most of the reasons given for using Maven fall apart when examined critically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Netbeans and Idea are overblown text editors, not object environments, but if you do want to use their tools for something not covered by the thousands of Eclipse plugins, both can import and maintain Eclipse projects, your build will just be inordinately slow compared to developers using Eclipse, but then, they'd be that slow if they were pure Netbeans or Idea projects anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not a serious reason to use Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ease of exporting / importing settings in Eclipse (something every team should do in any IDE in any case) makes the different settings problem nothing more than laziness on the part of the development team (or a religious argument over spaces vs tabs, lol).\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, not a serious reason to use Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team environment? Show me a team that doesn't already use a repository like GIT or SVN. Why do we need to duplicate both the functionality and the maintenance headache by setting up Nexus repos as well?\n",
    "\n",
    "That one's actually a good reason NOT to use Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running a server build? Great idea, now, shouldn't that be kicked off by code that's actually checked in to the source repo rather than a random build that happens to get pushed to Nexus? This brings up a point against Git, particularly Git with Maven. Since in Git I don't work on a branch, test locally, then commit (partly because my local test doesn't prove the server build works due to differences in the Maven configuration in Jenkins and Eclipse) I have to commit my changes to a different branch in order to see that the server Maven build fails, then commit a further change to fix the problem, resulting in an unreadable source history in the repo. Checked in code should at the very least build and pass unit tests, which if Git and Maven were out of the picture should be guaranteed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exporting a headless build from Eclipse is trivial if you actually look into it - all you need is ant or Gradle, the developer build already maintained by Eclipse, and a few Eclipse jars (Eclipse will export all the necessary files for a headless build to a directory or zip file, or ftp them to the build server). Server build tools like Hudson/Jenkins can pull updated code from most source repos and call any build script, there's no dependency on Maven. With Maven you either force developers to use a tool not suited to anybody but build engineers (the magnitudes longer it takes to build, even using M2E, is sufficient for that case to be made), or you live with the possibility that the server build doesn't work quite like the workstation build, which is still true if you go through all the hassle of integrating the two using the plethora of M2E plugins. Either way you get a slower and more fragile workstation build for the sake of an equally slow and more fragile server build. On every Maven based project I've worked on I've seen transient Hudson/Jenkins errors that don't show up in Eclipse unless you have absolutely every possible M2E plugin installed and correctly configured, and most developers never do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seems like another great reason to avoid Maven.\n",
    "\n",
    "That doesn't cover some of the more fundamental problems with Maven, such as its namespaces breaking Java namespaces and XML namespaces, it's build unit (the POM) having no relation to anything in the actual deployment environment (think about it, when you separate via POMs what are you actually accomplishing in the finished product? Nothing. All it accomplishes is a false sense that you've separated concerns and functionality into different build units that all run as one monolithic piece of code); the hassle of manually maintaining complex configuration files, which only gets worse if you happen to need to use OSGi or another container and have to maintain other config files that affect and are affected by the Maven config with very little obvious sense to it; the problems caused by trying to run unit tests without a full environment for the code to execute in; the myriad versions not only of dependencies but of Maven specific plugins (I've actually seen JAR hell in the Maven build itself where multiple Maven plugins were using conflicting dependencies - one of the problems Maven was supposed to solve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, you can build object code with Maven. You can also write pure object code in C or even assembler, but I don't know why you'd want to.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best reason to avoid Maven is the phenomenal amount of work required to de-mavenize a set of projects when you get sick of all the problems noted above (and numerous others not mentioned).\n",
    "\n",
    "The mindset, inherited from C development, that the development cycle consists of write code, compile, assemble, build, deploy, test, do over again, is hopelessly outdated in an object environment. At some point we need to tell all the people with this mindset that they need to relearn how to develop, period. Doing so would remove any need for Maven, Git, and a host of other tools that do nothing but waste time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object development should be done in a live object environment, where a code change is tested as it is saved since the modified object is live. Deployment should consist of removing development only artefacts from that environment, creating a runtime that has everything used by the running app in development and test.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm currently dealing with a problem caused by creating deployment assemblies for an OSGi app using the maven-assembly plugin. The app works perfectly in the Eclipse environment, which hot deploys all code changes into a running OSGi container within the environment. However the configuration doesn't survive intact through the maven-assembly process, despite having a very good configuration/build engineer whose sole job is to accomplish that process. If we got rid of Maven (very difficult now due to the amount of code, but possible) and used the BNDTOOLS Eclipse plugin we could simply export the Eclipse build as an Ant or Gradle headless build (note, the OSGi developers who write BND and BNDTOOLS don't support Maven, and for good reason, the Maven plugin is written by the Felix developers who themselves use Netbeans and Maven, and no live environment other than at the end of the deploy cycle), where both tools set up the same environment as Eclipse, without the GUI objects that are only meant for developers anyway. The result would be an identical configuration and build for deployment. This would easily save 2-3 hours per day per developer currently spent watching slow Maven or M2E builds, and free up the config/build engineer to do more testing of the app on the deployment hosts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Getting over the mindset of write/compile/assemble/build/deploy/test is the only major impediment. Pretending you're coding on a 1979 VT100 terminal instead of a modern machine doesn't make you a 'real' developer, it just demonstrates that your methods are 35 years out of date.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the developers on the team, none of the others properly understands a live object environment like Eclipse sufficiently to get it to work as a live environment with M2E and OSGi, and they are top developers, they just haven't been exposed to it due to the prevalence of outdated command line development tools. They only realized it was possible to do so when we were pair programming to solve the configuration problem and I was sharing my screen, causing one of the other team members to exclaim \"that's how you write code so damn fast\", when he saw my code change instantly test itself in the background OSGi container. I can use a bash shell when I have to, such as when I'm looking at logs on a remote server, in fact I do so fairly efficiently precisely so I can get out of that environment as quickly as possible and return to the 21st century."

    "**Answer2:**<br />\n",
    "A Class object is sort of a meta object describing the class of an object. It is used mostly with the reflection capabilities of Java. You can think of it like a \"blueprint\" of the actual class. E.g. you have a class Car like this:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public class Car {\n",
    "    public String brand;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can then construct a Class object which describes your \"Car\" class.\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Class myCarClass = Class.forName(\"Car\");\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now you can do all sorts of querying on your Car class on that Class object:\n",
    "\n",
    "    myCarClass.getName() - returns \"Car\"\n",
    "    myCarClass.getDeclaredField(\"brand\") - returns a Field object describing the \"brand\" field\n",
    "\n",
    "and so on. Every java object has a method getClass() which returns the Class object describing the Class of the Java object. So you could do something like:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Car myCar = new Car();\n",
    "Class myCarClass  = myCar.getClass();\n",
    "```\n",
    "This also works for objects you don't know, e.g objects you get from the outside:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "public void tellMeWhatThisObjectsClassIs(Object obj) {\n",
    "    System.out.println(obj.getClass().getName());\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could feed this method any java object and it will print the actual class of the object you have given to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with Java, most of the time you don't need to worry about Class objects. They have some handy use cases though. E.g. they allow you to programmatically instanciate objects of a certain class, which is used often for object serialization and deserialization (e.g. converting Java Objects to XML and back, well mostly back).\n",
    "```java\n",
    "Class myCarClass = Class.forName(\"Car\");\n",
    "Car myCar = myCarClass.newInstance();  // is roughly equivalent to = new Car();\n",
    "```\n",
    "You could also use it to find out all declared fields or methods of your class etc, which is very useful in certain cases. So e.g. if your method gets handed an unknown object and you need to know more about it, like if it imlements some interface etc, the Class class is your friend here.\n",
    "\n",
    "So long story short, the Class, Field, Method, etc. classes which are in the java.lang.reflect package allow you to analyze your defined classes, methods, fields, create new instances of them, call methods all kinds of other stuff and they allow you to do this dynamically at runtime. "

    "Overloading generally means that you have two or more functions in the same scope having the same name. The function that better matches the arguments when a call is made wins and is called. Important to note, as opposed to calling a virtual function, is that the function that's called is selected at compile time. It all depends on the static type of the argument. If you have an overload for B and one for D, and the argument is a reference to B, but it really points to a D object, then the overload for B is chosen in C++. That's called static dispatch as opposed to dynamic dispatch. You overload if you want to do the same as another function having the same name, but you want to do that for another argument type. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo const& f) {\n",
    "    // print a foo\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Bar const& bar) {\n",
    "    // print a bar\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "they both print their argument, so they are overloaded. But the first prints a foo, and the second prints a bar. If you have two functions that do different things, it's considered bad style when they have the same name, because that can lead to confusion about what will happen actually when calling the functions. Another usecase for overloading is when you have additional parameters for functions, but they just forward control to other functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo & f, PrintAttributes b) { \n",
    "    /`* ... *`/ \n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo & f, std::string const& header, bool printBold) {\n",
    "    print(f, PrintAttributes(header, printBold));\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be convenient for the caller, if the options that the overloads take are often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding is something completely different. It doesn't compete with overloading. It means that if you have a virtual function in a base class, you can write a function with the same signature in the derived class. The function in the derived class overrides the function of the base. Sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "struct base {\n",
    "    virtual void print() { cout << \"base!\"; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "struct derived: base {\n",
    "    virtual void print() { cout << \"derived!\"; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you have an object and call the print member function, the print function of the derived is always called, because it overrides the one of the base. If the function print wasn't virtual, then the function in the derived wouldn't override the base function, but would merely hide it. Overriding can be useful if you have a function that accepts a base class, and every one that's derived from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "void doit(base &b) {\n",
    "    // and sometimes, we want to print it\n",
    "    b.print();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, even though at compile time the compiler only knows that b is at least base, print of the derived class will be called. That's the point of virtual functions. Without them, the print function of the base would be called, and the one in the derived class wouldn't override it."

    "** Question** <br /> Why the overridden function in class derived has the keyword virtual in front of it? Is it mandatory to put virtual in front of the overriden in the derived class?  Ziezi Sep 28 '15 at 14:20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br /> @Ziezi no, in this example virtual makes no difference but people use it to make it clear that it's actually a virtual function which may be called, e.g., via a reference to the base class. There is a pitfall, if you write virtual void prinf(...){ ...} (typo in the name) you will get a virtual function but of course it isn't connected to base::print and the resulting bug could be subtle. In C++11 the override qualifier was added to explicitly state the override: if you write void prinf(...) override {...} you will get a compile error until you fix the typo. – greggo Oct 20 '16 at 16:51"

    "This article describes the capabilities provided by the javafx.concurrent package to create multithreaded applications. You learn how to keep your JavaFX application user interface (UI) responsive by delegating time-consuming task execution to background threads.\n",
    "Why Use the javafx.concurrent Package?\n",
    "\n",
    "The JavaFX scene graph, which represents the graphical user interface of a JavaFX application, is not thread-safe and can only be accessed and modified from the UI thread also known as the JavaFX Application thread. Implementing long-running tasks on the JavaFX Application thread inevitably makes an application UI unresponsive. A best practice is to do these tasks on one or more background threads and let the JavaFX Application thread process user events.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you implement a background worker by creating a Runnable object and a new thread, at some point, you must communicate with the JavaFX Application thread, either with a result or with the progress of the background task, which is error prone. Instead, use the JavaFX APIs provided by the javafx.concurrent package, which takes care of multithreaded code that interacts with the UI and ensures that this interaction happens on the correct thread.\n",
    "Overview of the javafx.concurrent Package\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java platform provides a complete set of concurrency libraries available through the java.util.concurrent package. The javafx.concurrent package leverages the existing API by considering the JavaFX Application thread and other constraints faced by GUI developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **javafx.concurrent package consists of the Worker interface and two basic classes, Task and Service, both of which implement the Worker interface.** <font color=\"red\">(kp: I think, it is somewhat like the relationship between the abstract class [WindowAdapter](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/WindowAdapter.html) and the interfaces **WindowListener, WindowStateListener, WindowFocusListener** which are implemented by the abstract class. I think that just as with the **WindowAdapter**, the **Task** and **Service** classes exist for convenience so that we don't have to define/implement all the method of the interface, rather only those which we are interested in or have use for us.)</font> The Worker interface provides APIs that are useful for a background worker to communicate with the UI. The Task class is a fully observable implementation of the java.util.concurrent.FutureTask class. The Task class enables developers to implement asynchronous tasks in JavaFX applications. The Service class executes tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The WorkerStateEvent class specifies an event that occurs whenever the state of a Worker implementation changes. Both the Task and Service classes implement the EventTarget interface and thus support listening to the state events."

    "### The Worker Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "The Worker interface defines an object that performs some work on one or more background threads. The state of the Worker object is observable and usable from the JavaFX Application thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lifecycle of the Worker object is defined as follows. When created, the Worker object is in the READY state. Upon being scheduled for work, the Worker object transitions to the SCHEDULED state. After that, when the Worker object is performing the work, its state becomes RUNNING. Note that even when the Worker object is immediately started without being scheduled, it first transitions to the SCHEDULED state and then to the RUNNING state. The state of a Worker object that completes successfully is SUCCEEDED, and the value property is set to the result of this Worker object. Otherwise, if any exceptions are thrown during the execution of the Worker object, its state becomes FAILED and the exception property is set to the type of the exception that occurred. At any time before the end of the Worker object the developer can interrupt it by invoking the cancel method, which puts the Worker object into the CANCELLED state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The progress of the work being done by the Worker object can be obtained through three different properties such as totalWork, workDone, and progress.\n",

    "\n",
    "The call method is invoked on the background thread, therefore this method can only manipulate states that are safe to read and write from a background thread. For example, manipulating an active scene graph from the call method throws runtime exceptions. On the other hand, the Task class is designed to be used with JavaFX GUI applications, and it ensures that any changes to public properties, change notifications for errors or cancellation, event handlers, and states occur on the JavaFX Application thread. Inside the call method, you can use the updateProgress, updateMessage, updateTitle methods, which update the values of the corresponding properties on the JavaFX Application thread. However, if the task was canceled, a return value from the call method is ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the Task class fits into the Java concurrency libraries because it inherits from the java.utils.concurrent.FutureTask class, which implements the Runnable interface. For this reason, a Task object can be used within the Java concurrency Executor API and also can be passed to a thread as a parameter. You can call the Task object directly by using the FutureTask.run() method, which enables calling this task from another background thread. Having a good understanding of the Java concurrency API will help you understand concurrency in JavaFX."

    "#### Four types of JDBC Drivers Available\n",
    "\n",
    "JDBC Drivers implement the defined interfaces in the JDBC API, for interacting with your database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using JDBC drivers enable you to open database connections and interact with it by sending SQL or Database commands, then receiving the results with java.\n",
    "\n",
    "The java.sql package (see java documentation available at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ and **java.sql** link on the top left panel, under **Packages**.)) that ships with JDK, contains various classes and interfaces with their behaviours defined and their actual implementations are done in third-party drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third party vendors implement the java.sql.driver interface in their database driver. For example, previously, we downloaded the MySQL databse driver from the vendor MySQL to use with the MySQL database server(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The four types of the JDBC drivers are:**\n",
    "* **JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver**\n",
    "    * Used to connect to or access the ODBC driver installed on each client machine. \n",
    "    * Requires configurations. \n",
    "    * Used with old java versions (because most databases in the past supported only ODBC access) or only for experimental purposes.\n",
    "* **JDBC-Native API**\n",
    "    * The JDBC API calls are converted into native C/C++ API calls, which is unique to the database. \n",
    "    * Typically provided by the database. \n",
    "    * Rendered and used in the same manner as the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.\n",
    "    * Must be installed on each client machine\n",
    "    * If you change the database, you have to change the native API as well, as it is specific to database.\n",
    "    * Better speed because it eliminates the ODBC overhead.\n",
    "    * An example - the **Oracle Call Interface (OCI)** driver \n",
    "* **JDBC-NET PURE JAVA** \n",
    "    * Three types of approaches (or 'Tree type approach??) used to access the database.\n",
    "        * JDBC client uses standard network socket to communicate with a middleware application server. The socket information is then translated by a middleware application server into a call format required by DBMS and forwarded to database server.\n",
    "        * This kind of driver is extremely flexible since it requires no code installed on the client and a single driver can actually provide access to multiple databases.\n",
    "        * You think of applications server as a JDBC proxy meaning it makes calls from the client applicaiton as a result and you need some knowledge of application server configuration in order to effectively use this type of drivers.\n",
    "* **100% Pure Java Based Drivers**   \n",
    "    * These drivers communicate directly with the vendor database through a socket connection. \n",
    "    * These are the highest performace drivers available and are usually provided by the vendor itself. \n",
    "    * Example the Java drivers downloaded (see above) from the mysql.com intended for use with their own DBMS i.e. the MySQL server."
