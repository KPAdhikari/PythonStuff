    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Overloading generally means that you have two or more functions in the same scope having the same name. The function that better matches the arguments when a call is made wins and is called. Important to note, as opposed to calling a virtual function, is that the function that's called is selected at compile time. It all depends on the static type of the argument. If you have an overload for B and one for D, and the argument is a reference to B, but it really points to a D object, then the overload for B is chosen in C++. That's called static dispatch as opposed to dynamic dispatch. You overload if you want to do the same as another function having the same name, but you want to do that for another argument type. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo const& f) {\n",
    "    // print a foo\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Bar const& bar) {\n",
    "    // print a bar\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "they both print their argument, so they are overloaded. But the first prints a foo, and the second prints a bar. If you have two functions that do different things, it's considered bad style when they have the same name, because that can lead to confusion about what will happen actually when calling the functions. Another usecase for overloading is when you have additional parameters for functions, but they just forward control to other functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo & f, PrintAttributes b) { \n",
    "    /`* ... *`/ \n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "void print(Foo & f, std::string const& header, bool printBold) {\n",
    "    print(f, PrintAttributes(header, printBold));\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "That can be convenient for the caller, if the options that the overloads take are often used.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding is something completely different. It doesn't compete with overloading. It means that if you have a virtual function in a base class, you can write a function with the same signature in the derived class. The function in the derived class overrides the function of the base. Sample:\n",
    "\n",
    "struct base {\n",
    "    virtual void print() { cout << \"base!\"; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "struct derived: base {\n",
    "    virtual void print() { cout << \"derived!\"; }\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you have an object and call the print member function, the print function of the derived is always called, because it overrides the one of the base. If the function print wasn't virtual, then the function in the derived wouldn't override the base function, but would merely hide it. Overriding can be useful if you have a function that accepts a base class, and every one that's derived from it:\n",
    "\n",
    "void doit(base &b) {\n",
    "    // and sometimes, we want to print it\n",
    "    b.print();\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, even though at compile time the compiler only knows that b is at least base, print of the derived class will be called. That's the point of virtual functions. Without them, the print function of the base would be called, and the one in the derived class wouldn't override it."

    "** Question** <br /> Why the overridden function in class derived has the keyword virtual in front of it? Is it mandatory to put virtual in front of the overriden in the derived class?  Ziezi Sep 28 '15 at 14:20\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** <br /> @Ziezi no, in this example virtual makes no difference but people use it to make it clear that it's actually a virtual function which may be called, e.g., via a reference to the base class. There is a pitfall, if you write virtual void prinf(...){ ...} (typo in the name) you will get a virtual function but of course it isn't connected to base::print and the resulting bug could be subtle. In C++11 the override qualifier was added to explicitly state the override: if you write void prinf(...) override {...} you will get a compile error until you fix the typo. – greggo Oct 20 '16 at 16:51"

JFrame.getContentPane() just returns a Container to place the Components that you want to display in the JFrame. Internally, it's using a JPanel (by default - you can change this by calling setContentPane()) As for why it's returning a Container instead of a JPanel - it's because you should [program to an interface, not an implementation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/383947/what-does-it-mean-to-program-to-an-interface) - at that level, all that you need to care about is that you can add Components to something - and even though Container is a class rather than an interface - it provides the interface needed to do exactly that.\n",

    "#### Four types of JDBC Drivers Available\n",
    "\n",
    "JDBC Drivers implement the defined interfaces in the JDBC API, for interacting with your database server.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, using JDBC drivers enable you to open database connections and interact with it by sending SQL or Database commands, then receiving the results with java.\n",
    "\n",
    "The java.sql package (see java documentation available at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/ and **java.sql** link on the top left panel, under **Packages**.)) that ships with JDK, contains various classes and interfaces with their behaviours defined and their actual implementations are done in third-party drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third party vendors implement the java.sql.driver interface in their database driver. For example, previously, we downloaded the MySQL databse driver from the vendor MySQL to use with the MySQL database server(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "**The four types of the JDBC drivers are:**\n",
    "* **JDBC-ODBC Bridge Driver**\n",
    "    * Used to connect to or access the ODBC driver installed on each client machine. \n",
    "    * Requires configurations. \n",
    "    * Used with old java versions (because most databases in the past supported only ODBC access) or only for experimental purposes.\n",
    "* **JDBC-Native API**\n",
    "    * The JDBC API calls are converted into native C/C++ API calls, which is unique to the database. \n",
    "    * Typically provided by the database. \n",
    "    * Rendered and used in the same manner as the JDBC-ODBC Bridge.\n",
    "    * Must be installed on each client machine\n",
    "    * If you change the database, you have to change the native API as well, as it is specific to database.\n",
    "    * Better speed because it eliminates the ODBC overhead.\n",
    "    * An example - the **Oracle Call Interface (OCI)** driver \n",
    "* **JDBC-NET PURE JAVA** \n",
    "    * Three types of approaches (or 'Tree type approach??) used to access the database.\n",
    "        * JDBC client uses standard network socket to communicate with a middleware application server. The socket information is then translated by a middleware application server into a call format required by DBMS and forwarded to database server.\n",
    "        * This kind of driver is extremely flexible since it requires no code installed on the client and a single driver can actually provide access to multiple databases.\n",
    "        * You think of applications server as a JDBC proxy meaning it makes calls from the client applicaiton as a result and you need some knowledge of application server configuration in order to effectively use this type of drivers.\n",
    "* **100% Pure Java Based Drivers**   \n",
    "    * These drivers communicate directly with the vendor database through a socket connection. \n",
    "    * These are the highest performace drivers available and are usually provided by the vendor itself. \n",
    "    * Example the Java drivers downloaded (see above) from the mysql.com intended for use with their own DBMS i.e. the MySQL server."
