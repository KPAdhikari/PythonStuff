    "### Program Starts by Opening the GUI in EDT\n",
    "The program starts from the main method in Class '[DC_App.java](https://github.com/ShivaramKPA/VariousTests/blob/master/src/swing/consoles/DC_App.java)' (name may change later) and the method has only one line to create an object of **DC_GUI** class as follows:\n",

    "Please note that this GUI opens in the **Event Dispatch Thread (EDT)** just as any SWING windows would do and this thread is different from the **main** thread which will exit early because in Java, it's possible for a program/process to survive even after the **main** thread exits if there is at least one non-Daemon thread still alive & running, which in this case is **EDT** at least.\n",

    "### DC_GUI class - Defining, Initializing and Displaying the GUI\n",
    "Here is what this class does:\n",
    "* Defines the GUI windows and accessories/componets (panels, labels, buttons, textfields etc)\n",
    "    * Prepare the main JFrame object for the main window\n",
    "    * Create File Chooser and add it to the main window\n",
    "    * Display the main window with its components\n",
    "* Launch two threads with '**this**' object passed as the argument to each. These two threads run in parallel and redirect the standard-output and standard-error to our own console/text area respectively, with the help of objects of types **PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream**. These two threads are start()ed immediately after the main GUI is made visible (displayed), which means the 'run()' method (the implemented method of the Runnable interface) of this object will be executed by both of these threads.\n",
    "    * Please note that the passing of 'this' means, the reference to the same GUI object of type DC_GUI (not two different objects of the same type) is passed to these threads, thus the two threads will be interacting with the same object concurrently. For example, in our case, the 'this' reference is equivalent to 'mk'. \n",
    "        * So, it is important to remember that the window we open is a JFrame object member of bigger object 'mk' and the reference to that same object is what is passed to the two piped-stream threads.\n",
    "* And adds various action-listeners to the window itself as well as to various components.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we define the class **DC_GUI** extending **WindowAdapter** and implementing the following three interfaces - **WindowListener, ActionListener, Runnable** as follows:\n",

    "#### So, why do we extend WindowAdapter or Implement  WindowListener, ActionListener, Runnable?\n",
    "* <font color='red'>First off, why extend **WindowAdapter** abstract class?</font>\n",
    "    - The **windowClosed(..), windowClosing(..)** etc are some of the (synchronized) methods of the WindowListener interface. We don't have to implement all the methods of this interface here because this class also extends WindowAdapter which is an abstract adapter class for receiving window events. The methods in this abstract class are empty and the class exists as convenience for creating listener objects. \n",
    "        - If you implement the WindowListener interface, you have to define all of the    methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.\n",
    "        - see https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/WindowListener.html and https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/awt/event/WindowAdapter.html The latter webpage says the following about WindowAdapter abstract class:\n",
    "            - Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a Window (frame in our case) using the window's addWindowListener method (for example see the line 'frame.addWindowListener(this)' above. When the window's status changes by virtue of being opened, closed, activated or deactivated, iconified or deiconified, the relevant method in the listener object ('this' object in this/our case) is invoked, and the WindowEvent is passed to it.\n",
    "    - If we don't use the WindowAdapter and only depend on JFrame, we can still make it exit on closing of the window by invoking the following line **frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);**, but we cannot make it do anything more when it is ready to close or when it is closed already. With the extension of the WindowAdapter abstract class, now we can add any functionality we want putting the corresponding code inside the methods **windowClosed(..), windowClosing(..)**. For example, inside the synchronzed **windowClosed(WindowEvent ev)** method of the current DC_GUI case, we put code for invoking the 'join()' methods on the two **redirection** threads 'reader' and 'reader2'and also for closing the pipedStream objects 'pin' and 'pin2'. Likewise, inside the synchronized method **windowClosing(WindowEvent ev)** we put only two lines as follows:\n",
    "```java\n",
    "        frame.setVisible(false); // default behaviour of JFrame\n",
    "        frame.dispose();\n",
    "```"

    "* <font color='red'>Next, why implement the **WindowListener** interface?</font> Isn't it superfluous to implement it if we are also extending the WindowAdapter?\n",
    "    * I think that indeed seems to be the case. I mean the implementation of WindowListener is superfluous indeed. I simply removed the WindowListener from the class declaration and executed the program and it still ran as before with no difference or side effects.\n",
    "* <font color='red'>Next, why implement the **ActionListener** interface?</font> Is it also avoidable?\n",
    "    * Because of the implementation of this interface, we have the method **public synchronized void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) ** implemented but it seems not much is done inside this method. So, may be we could live without implementing this interface. I need to think more about it.\n",
    "* <font color='red'>Next, why implement the **Runnable** interface?</font> Is it also avoidable?  <a id='implementsRunnable'></a> \n",
    "    * The overriden **run()** method is associated with the Runnable and the method is executed when the **start()** method is invoked on the thread which was created by passing the **this** object. In our case we create two such threads 'reader' and 'reader2' which do the grunt work of redirecting the standard outputs and errors to our own text area.\n",
    "        * And, inside the [run()](#runMethod) method we have two identical if-blocks - one for thread 'reader' and another for 'reader2' - that takes care of how to process and where to display the redirected standard outputs and errors. The 'reader' redirects standard-output with the help of PipedInputStream object 'pin' and 'reader2' redirects standard-errors using 'pin2'. Please note that these two threads run in the background because they are made 'daemon' threads in the beginning by invoking their methods 'setDaemon(true)' (which is done just before the start() method is called)."

    "* During each iteration, it sits quiet (waits) for 100 milli seconds (1/10th of a second) doing nothing.\n",
    "* As the 100 ms wait is over, it retrieves the bytestream from pin or pin2, which is then parsed by the local function 'readLine(pin or pin2)' and then dumped onto the textArea of our own.\n",
    "* At the end of each iteration, it also checks whether the value of 'quit' has flipped to 'true' or not. If it did flip, the thread returns or exits, otherwise, it starts another iteration of the while-loop that start by waiting for 100 ms as stated above. \n",
