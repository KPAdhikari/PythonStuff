The term programming language usually refers to high-level languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, FORTRAN, Ada, and Pascal. Each language has a unique set of keywords (words that it understands) and a special syntax for organizing program instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "High-level programming languages, while simple compared to human languages, are more complex than the languages the computer actually understands, called machine languages. Each different type of CPU has its own unique machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lying between machine languages and high-level languages are languages called assembly languages. Assembly languages are similar to machine languages, but they are much easier to program in because they allow a programmer to substitute names for numbers. Machine languages consist of numbers only.\n",

    "Lying above high-level languages are languages called fourth-generation languages (usually abbreviated 4GL). 4GLs are far removed from machine languages and represent the class of computer languages closest to human languages.\n",
    "Regardless of what language you use, you eventually need to convert your program into machine language so that the computer can understand it.\n",

    "    –compile the program\n",
    "    –interpret the program\n",

    "The question of which language is best is one that consumes a lot of time and energy among computer professionals. Every language has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, FORTRAN is a particularly good language for processing numerical data, but it does not lend itself very well to organizing large programs. Pascal is very good for writing well-structured and readable programs, but it is not as flexible as the C programming language. C++ embodies powerful object-oriented features, but it is complex and difficult to learn.\n",

    "From Ref1: \n",
    "The von Neumann architecture, which is also known as the von Neumann model and Princeton architecture, is a computer architecture based on the 1945 description by the mathematician and physicist John von Neumann and others in the First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC.[1] This describes a design architecture for an electronic digital computer with parts consisting of a processing unit containing an arithmetic logic unit and processor registers; a control unit containing an instruction register and program counter; a memory to store both data and instructions; external mass storage; and input and output mechanisms.[1][2] The meaning has evolved to be any stored-program computer in which an instruction fetch and a data operation cannot occur at the same time because they share a common bus. This is referred to as the von Neumann bottleneck and often limits the performance of the system.[3]\n",

    "* This novel idea meant that a computer built with this architecture would be much easier to re-program (otherwise, one would have to get into the guts of the machine to re-arrange  the hardware and effectively reprogram the software. After this novel idea, no need to rework the hardware.\n",

    "\n",
    "The **Von-Neumann architecture** describes the stored-program computer where instructions and data are stored in memory and the machine works by changing its internal state, i.e an instruction operates on some data and modifies the data. So inherently, there is state maintained in the system.\n",

    "The **Turing machine architecture** works by manipulating symbols on a tape. i.e A tape with infinite number of slots exists, and at any one point in time, the Turing machine is in a particular slot. Based on the symbol read at that slot, the machine can change the symbol and move to a different slot. All of this is deterministic.\n",

    "* Can we say that Turing model is a superset of Von Newman model?\n",
    "* Does functional Programming fit into Turing model? If so, how? I assume functional programing does not lend itself nicely to the Von Neuman model.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Answer 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Turing machines are theoretical concepts invented to explore the domain of computable problems mathematically and to obtain ways of describing these computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Von-Neumann architecture is an architecture for constructing actual computers (which implement what the Turing machine describes theoretically).\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional programming is based on the [lambda-calculus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus), which is a another method of describing computations or - more precisely - computable functions. Though it uses a completely different approach, it is equally powerful to Turing machine (it's said to be turing complete).\n",
    "\n",
    "Every lambda-calculus program (term) T is written just using a combination of\n",
    "\n",
    "    variables like x\n",
    "    anonymous functions like λx. T\n",
    "    function applications T T\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being stateless, this is **sufficient** (kp: links to [Church encoding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_encoding)) for every computation a computer can do. Turing machines and lambda terms can emulate each other, and a Von-Neumann computer can execute both (apart from technical restrictions like providing infinite storage, which a turing machine could require).\n",
    "\n",
    "But due to their stateless and more abstract nature, functional programs might be less efficient and less \"intuitive\" on Von-Neumann computers compared to imperative programs which follow it's style of binary, memory and update.\n"

    "In computer architecture, a processor register is a quickly accessible location available to a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Registers usually consist of a small amount of fast storage, although some registers have specific hardware functions, and may be read-only or write-only. Registers are typically addressed by mechanisms other than main memory, but may in some cases be assigned a memory address e.g. DEC PDP-10, ICT 1900.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all computers, whether load/store architecture or not, load data from a larger memory into registers where it is used for arithmetic operations and is manipulated or tested by machine instructions. Manipulated data is then often stored back to main memory, either by the same instruction or by a subsequent one. Modern processors use either static or dynamic RAM as main memory, with the latter usually accessed via one or more cache levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Processor registers are normally at the top of the memory hierarchy, and provide the fastest way to access data. The term normally refers only to the group of registers that are directly encoded as part of an instruction, as defined by the instruction set. However, modern high-performance CPUs often have duplicates of these \"architectural registers\" in order to improve performance via register renaming, allowing parallel and speculative execution. Modern x86 design acquired these techniques around 1995 with the releases of Pentium Pro, Cyrix 6x86, Nx586, and AMD K5.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common property of computer programs is locality of reference, which refers to accessing the same values repeatedly and holding frequently used values in registers to improve performance; this makes fast registers and caches meaningful.[1] Allocating frequently used variables to registers can be critical to a program's performance; this register allocation is performed either by a compiler in the code generation phase, or manually by an assembly language programmer."

However, \"pointer\" is also the most complex and difficult feature in C/C++ language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointers are extremely powerful because they allows you to access addresses and manipulate their contents. But they are also extremely complex to handle. Using them correctly, they could greatly improve the efficiency and performance. On the other hand, using them incorrectly could lead to many problems, from un-readable and un-maintainable codes, to infamous bugs such as memory leaks and buffer overflow, which may expose your system to hacking. Many new languages (such as Java and C#) remove pointer from their syntax to avoid the pitfalls of pointers, by providing automatic memory management.\n",

    "#### Pointer Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer memory location has an address and holds a content. The address is a numerical number (often expressed in hexadecimal), which is hard for programmers to use directly. Typically, each address location holds 8-bit (i.e., 1-byte) of data. It is entirely up to the programmer to interpret the meaning of the data, such as integer, real number, characters or strings.\n",

    "To ease the burden of programming using numerical address and programmer-interpreted data, early programming languages (such as C) introduce the concept of variables. A variable is a named location that can store a value of a particular type. Instead of numerical addresses, names (or identifiers) are attached to certain addresses. Also, types (such as int, double, char) are associated with the contents for ease of interpretation of data.\n",

    "##### Pointer Variables (or Pointers)\n",
    "\n",
    "A pointer variable (or pointer in short) is basically the same as the other variables, which can store a piece of data. Unlike normal variable which stores a value (such as an int, a double, a char), a pointer stores a memory address."

    "#### Possible reason(s) of confusion between the two\n",
    "_One of the reasons for the confusion between the two could be due to the fact that when we try to define or talk about pointers, we talk about referencing and dereferencing. For example, we can look at the following excerpt from the wikipedia article on pointers._\n",
    "\n",
    "From [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_%28computer_programming%29):<br />\n",
    "In computer science, a pointer is a programming language object, whose value refers to (or \"points to\") another value stored elsewhere in the computer memory using its memory address. A pointer references a location in memory, and obtaining the value stored at that location is known as dereferencing the pointer. As an analogy, a page number in a book's index could be considered a pointer to the corresponding page; dereferencing such a pointer would be done by flipping to the page with the given page number and reading the text found on the indexed page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointers to data significantly improve performance for repetitive operations such as traversing strings, lookup tables, control tables and tree structures. In particular, it is often much cheaper in time and space to copy and dereference pointers than it is to copy and access the data to which the pointers point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointers are also used to hold the addresses of entry points for called subroutines in procedural programming and for run-time linking to dynamic link libraries (DLLs). In object-oriented programming, pointers to functions are used for binding methods, often using what are called virtual method tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A pointer is a simple, more concrete implementation of the more abstract [reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_%28computer_science%29) data type**. Several languages support some type of pointer, although some have more restrictions on their use than others. **While \"pointer\" has been used to refer to references in general**, it more properly applies to data structures whose interface explicitly allows the pointer to be manipulated (arithmetically via pointer arithmetic) as a memory address, as opposed to a magic cookie or capability where this is not possible.[citation needed] Because pointers allow both protected and unprotected access to memory addresses, there are risks associated with using them particularly in the latter case. **Primitive pointers are often stored in a format similar to an integer; however, attempting to dereference or \"look up\" a pointer whose value was never a valid memory address would cause a program to crash. To alleviate this potential problem, as a matter of type safety, pointers are considered a separate type parameterized by the type of data they point to, even if the underlying representation is an integer.** Other measures may also be taken (such as validation & bounds checking), to verify the contents of the pointer variable contain a value that is both a valid memory address and within the numerical range that the processor is capable of addressing."

    "_Next, let's see what the wiki article on References says._\n",
    "\n",
    "From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_%28computer_science%29)<br />\n",
    "In computer science, a reference is a value that enables a program to indirectly access a particular datum, such as a variable's value or a record, in the computer's memory or in some other storage device. The reference is said to refer to the datum, and accessing the datum is called dereferencing the reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "A reference is distinct from the datum itself. **Typically, for references to data stored in memory on a given system, a reference is implemented as the physical address of where the data is stored in memory or in the storage device. For this reason, a reference is often erroneously confused with a pointer or address, and is said to \"point to\" the data.** However a reference may also be implemented in other ways, such as the offset (difference) between the datum's address and some fixed \"base\" address, as an index into an array, or more abstractly as a handle. More broadly, in networking, references may be network addresses, such as URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The concept of reference must not be confused with other values (keys or identifiers) that uniquely identify the data item, but give access to it only through a non-trivial lookup operation in some table data structure.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**References are widely used in programming, especially to efficiently pass large or mutable data as arguments to procedures, or to share such data among various uses.In particular, a reference may point to a variable or record that contains references to other data. This idea is the basis of indirect addressing and of many linked data structures, such as linked lists.**  References can cause significant complexity in a program, partially due to the possibility of dangling and wild references and partially because the topology of data with references is a directed graph, whose analysis can be quite complicated."

  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "#### Examples\n",
    "Pointers are the most primitive. **Due to their intimate relationship with the underlying hardware, they are one of the most powerful and efficient types of references.** However, also due to this relationship, pointers require a strong understanding by the programmer of the details of memory architecture. Because pointers store a memory location's address, instead of a value directly, inappropriate use of pointers can lead to undefined behavior in a program, particularly due to dangling pointers or wild pointers. Smart pointers are opaque data structures that act like pointers but can only be accessed through particular methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**A handle is an abstract reference**, and may be represented in various ways. A common example are file handles (the FILE data structure in the C standard I/O library), used to abstract file content. It usually represents both the file itself, as when requesting a lock on the file, and a specific position within the file's content, as when reading a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "In distributed computing, the reference may contain more than an address or identifier; it may also include an embedded specification of the network protocols used to locate and access the referenced object, the way information is encoded or serialized. Thus, for example, a WSDL description of a remote web service can be viewed as a form of reference; it includes a complete specification of how to locate and bind to a particular web service. A reference to a live distributed object is another example: it is a complete specification for how to construct a small software component called a proxy that will subsequently engage in a peer-to-peer interaction, and through which the local machine may gain access to data that is replicated or exists only as a weakly consistent message stream. In all these cases, the reference includes the full set of instructions, or a recipe, for how to access the data; in this sense, it serves the same purpose as an identifier or address in memory."

As a result, if you have a variable whose purpose is to refer to another object, but it is possible that there might not be an object to refer to, you should make the variable a pointer, because then you can set it to null. On the other hand, if the variable must always refer to an object, i.e., if your design does not allow for the possibility that the variable is null, you should probably make the variable a reference."

    "                         // s1 is unchanged   \n",
    "```\n",
    "In general, you should use a pointer whenever you need to take into account the possibility that there's nothing to refer to (in which case you can set the pointer to null) or whenever you need to be able to refer to different things at different times (in which case you can change where the pointer points). You should use a reference whenever you know there will always be an object to refer to and you also know that once you're referring to that object, you'll never want to refer to anything else.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one other situation in which you should use a reference, and that's when you're implementing certain operators. The most common example is operator [ ]. This operator typically needs to return something that can be used as the target of an assignment:\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "vector<int> v(10);       // create an int vector of size 10;  \n",
    "                         // vector is a template in the  \n",
    "                         // standard C++ library  \n",
    "v[5] = 10;               // the target of this assignment is  \n",
    "                         // the return value of operator[] \n",
    "```    \n",
    "If operator[] returned a pointer, this last statement would have to be written this way:\n",
    "`*`v[5] = 10;\n",
    "\n",
    "But this makes it look like v is a vector of pointers, which it's not. For this reason, you'll almost always want operator [ ] to return a reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "References, then, are the feature of choice when you know you have something to refer to, when you'll never want to refer to anything else, and when implementing operators whose syntactic requirements make the use of pointers undesirable. In all other cases, stick with pointers."

    "* **Object (data) types** are complex data types - those that have more entities/members than just one data value. Most of the times the objects have some data members (could be primitive or a mixture of both) and some methods/functions which offer a gateway/interface to access (from outside) those data members. (Accessing means either just reading off their values or modifying or manipulating them.). Objects are building blocks or foundations of Object Oriented Programming and they are **created in two ways:**\n",

    "        - From Wikipedia: Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming. Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.\n",
    "        - Prototype object oriented programming uses generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended. Using fruit as an example, a \"fruit\" object would represent the properties and functionality of fruit in general. A \"banana\" object would be cloned from the \"fruit\" object, and would also be extended to include general properties specific to bananas. Each individual \"banana\" object would be cloned from the generic \"banana\" object. Compare to the class-based paradigm, where a \"fruit\" class (not object) would be extended by a \"banana\" class.\n",
    "        - The first prototype-oriented programming language was Self, developed by David Ungar and Randall Smith in the mid-1980s to research topics in object-oriented language design. Since the late 1990s, the classless paradigm has grown increasingly popular.[citation needed] Some current prototype-oriented languages are JavaScript (and other ECMAScript implementations such as JScript and Flash's ActionScript 1.0), Lua, Cecil, NewtonScript, Io, Ioke, MOO, REBOL, Lisaac and AHk.\n",

Access specifiers for classes:- When a class is declared as public, it is accessible to other classes defined in the same package as well as those defined in other packages. This is the most commonly used specifier for classes. A class cannot be declared as private. If no access specifier is stated, the default access restrictions will be applied. The class will be accessible to other classes in the same package but will be inaccessible to classes outside the package. When we say that a class is inaccessible, it simply means that we cannot create an object of that class or declare a variable of that class type. The protected access specifier too cannot be applied to a class.\n",

    "* Elements of the heap have no dependencies with each other and can always be accessed randomly at any time. We can allocate a block at any time and free it at any time.\n",

We can use heap if we don't know exactly how much data we will need at runtime or if we need to allocate a lot of data. _(kp: It means, even if we know exactly how much we need but if it's a lot, then we should use the heap rather than stack, which is limited in size)_.\n",

When you call fork, you're creating a copy of your own process that has its own address space. This allows multiple tasks to run independently of one another as though they each had the full memory of the machine to themselves.\n",

    "* Your shell uses fork to run the programs you invoke from the command line.\n",

    "* Web servers like apache use fork to create multiple server processes, each of which handles requests in its own address space. If one dies or leaks memory, others are unaffected, so it functions as a mechanism for fault tolerance.\n",
    "* Google Chrome uses fork to handle each page within a separate process. This will prevent client-side code on one page from bringing your whole browser down.\n",
    "    * This was what I thought initially about these child processes created by fork() or spawn(). Which means I thought to achieve the thread like parallelism (to execute some parallel tasks) was to make these system calls and utilize the resulting child processes. But, it turns out, it has more purpose than just that.\n",
    "* fork is used to spawn processes in some parallel programs (like those written using MPI). Note this is different from using threads, which don't have their own address space and exist within a process.\n",

    "\n",
    "Processes creation is achieved in 2 steps in a UNIX system: the fork and the exec.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every process is created using the fork system call. We won’t cover system calls in this post, but you can imagine them as a way for a program to send a message to the kernel (in this case, asking for the creation of a new process).\n",
    "\n",
    "What fork does is create a copy of the calling process. The newly created process is called the child, and the caller is the parent. This child process inherits everything that the parent has in memory, it’s an almost exact copy (pid and ppid are different, for instance).\n",
    "One thing to be aware of is that if a process is using 200MB of memory, when it forks a child, the newly created process will use more 200MB. This can easily become an accidental “fork bomb”, that will consume all the available resources of the machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is the exec. What exec does is replace the current process with a new one. The caller process is gone forever, and the new process takes its place. If you try to run this command in a terminal session:\n",
    "\n",
    "    exec vim\n",
    "\n",
    "vim will be opened normally, as it was a direct call to it, but as soon as you close it, you will see that the terminal is gone as well. So here’s what happened:\n",
    "You had a shell process running (bash, zsh or similar). In the moment that you called exec, passing vim and a parameter, it replaced the bash process with a vim process, so when you close vim, there is no shell there anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will see this fork + exec pattern all over the place in a UNIX system. If you are running a bash process, when you call, say, ls, to list your files, what actually is done is exactly this. The bash process calls fork to create an exact copy of itself, then call exec, to replace this copy with the ls process. When the ls process exits, you are back to the parent process, that is bash. And talking about a process exiting…\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Processes always exit with an exit code\n",

    "After boot time and before you run a program, you can think of your computer as containing a zoo of processes that are all waiting for something to do. They're all waiting on events. An event can be you pressing a key or moving a mouse. Or, if your machine is hooked to a network, an event can be a data packet coming in over that network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The kernel is one of these processes. It's a special one, because it controls when the other user processes can run, and it is normally the only process with direct access to the machine's hardware. In fact, user processes have to make requests to the kernel when they want to get keyboard input, write to your screen, read from or write to disk, or do just about anything other than crunching bits in memory. These requests are known as system calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally all I/O goes through the kernel so it can schedule the operations and prevent processes from stepping on each other. A few special user processes are allowed to slide around the kernel, usually by being given direct access to I/O ports. X servers are the most common example of this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will run programs in one of two ways: through your X server or through a shell. Often, you'll actually do both, because you'll start a terminal emulator that mimics an old-fashioned textual console, giving you a shell to run programs from. I'll describe what happens when you do that, then I'll return to what happens when you run a program through an X menu or desktop icon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shell is called the shell because it wraps around and hides the operating system kernel. It's an important feature of Unix that the shell and kernel are separate programs communicating through a small set of system calls. This makes it possible for there to be multiple shells, suiting different tastes in interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal shell gives you the ‘$’ prompt that you see after logging in (unless you've customized it to be something else). We won't talk about shell syntax and the easy things you can see on the screen here; instead we'll take a look behind the scenes at what's happening from the computer's point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The shell is just a user process, and not a particularly special one. It waits on your keystrokes, listening (through the kernel) to the keyboard I/O port. As the kernel sees them, it echoes them to your virtual console or X terminal emulator. When the kernel sees an ‘Enter’ it passes your line of text to the shell. The shell tries to interpret those keystrokes as commands.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Let's say you type ‘ls’ and Enter to invoke the Unix directory lister. The shell applies its built-in rules to figure out that you want to run the executable command in the file /bin/ls. It makes a system call asking the kernel to start /bin/ls as a new child process and give it access to the screen and keyboard through the kernel. Then the shell goes to sleep, waiting for ls to finish.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**When /bin/ls is done, it tells the kernel it's finished by issuing an exit system call. The kernel then wakes up the shell and tells it it can continue running. The shell issues another prompt and waits for another line of input.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Other things may be going on while your ‘ls’ is executing, however (we'll have to suppose that you're listing a very long directory). You might switch to another virtual console, log in there, and start a game of Quake, for example. Or, suppose you're hooked up to the Internet. Your machine might be sending or receiving mail while /bin/ls runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you're running programs through the X server rather than a shell (that is, by choosing an application from a pull-down menu, or double-clicking a desktop icon), any of several programs associated with your X server can behave like a shell and launch the program. I'm going to gloss over the details here because they're both variable and unimportant. The key point is that the X server, unlike a normal shell, doesn't go to sleep while the client program is running — instead, it sits between you and the client, passing your mouse clicks and keypresses to it and fulfilling its requests to point pixels on your display."

    "### Fork\n",
    "\n",
    "When you come to metaphorical \"fork in the road\" you generally have two options to take, and your decision effects your future. Computer programs reach this fork in the road when they hit the fork() system call.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the operating system will create a new process that is exactly the same as the parent process. This means all the state that was talked about previously is copied, including open files, register state and all memory allocations, which includes the program code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value from the system call is the only way the process can determine if it was the existing process or a new one. The return value to the parent process will be the Process ID (PID) of the child, whilst the child will get a return value of 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we say the process has forked and we have the parent-child relationship as described above.\n",
    "### Exec\n",
    "\n",
    "Forking provides a way for an existing process to start a new one, but what about the case where the new process is not part of the same program as parent process? This is the case in the shell; when a user starts a command it needs to run in a new process, but it is unrelated to the shell.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where the _exec_ system call comes into play. _exec_ will replace the contents of the currently running process with the information from a program binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus the process the shell follows when launching a new program is to firstly fork, creating a new process, and then exec (i.e. load into memory and execute) the program binary it is supposed to run.\n",

    "_clone_ allows you to explicitly specify which parts of the new process are copied into the new process, and which parts are shared between the two processes. This may seem a bit strange at first, but allows us to easily implement threads with one very simple interface.\n",
    "#### Threads\n",
    "\n",

    "* Typical difference is that threads run in a shared memory space, while processes run in separate memory spaces.\n",
    "* A process has a self contained execution environment, meaning it has a complete, private set of basic run time resources, particularly each process has its own memory space (in other words, it doesn't share a memory space with any other process).

    "* Each process provides the resources needed to execute a program. Each process is started with a single thread, known as the primary thread. The process then may have multiple threads thereafter.\n",
    "* On a multiprocessor system, multiple processes can be executed in parallel. _(kp: I think in a single processor machine, true-parallelism isn't possible, rather some processes may run that may feel like running in parallel, but actually they are running alternatingly on tiny time splits.)_ Multiple threads of control can exploit the true parallelism possible on multiprocessor systems.\n",
    "* Threads have direct access to the data segment of its process but processes have their own copy of the data segment of the parent process.\n",
    "* Changes to the main thread may affect the behavior of the other threads of the process, whereas changes to the parent process doesn't affect child processes.\n",

    "## Threads in Java GUI (with SWING) - Initial vs SwingWorker vs Event Dispatch threads\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lesson: Concurrency in Swing\n",
    "[Examples Index](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/examples/concurrency/index.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson discusses concurrency as it applies to Swing programming. It assumes that you are already familiar with the content of the [Concurrency lesson](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/index.html) in the [Essential Classes](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/index.html) trail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Careful use of concurrency is particularly important to the Swing programmer. A well-written Swing program uses concurrency to create a user interface that never \"freezes\" — the program is always responsive to user interaction, no matter what it's doing. To create a responsive program, the programmer must learn how the Swing framework employs threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Swing programmer deals with the following kinds of threads:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Initial threads**, the threads that execute initial application code.\n",
    "    * kp: From Article below: **In Swing programs, the initial threads don't have a lot to do. Their most essential job is to create a Runnable object (that initializes the GUI) and schedule that object for execution on the event dispatch thread.**\n",
    "    * kp: But in other (no-GUI) Java programs, the main may do all or significant part of the job to be accomplished by the whole program.\n",
    "* The **event dispatch thread** (EDT), where all event-handling code is executed. Most code that interacts with the Swing framework must also execute on this thread.\n",
    "* **Worker threads** (kp: **SWING Workers**), also known as background threads, where time-consuming background tasks are executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer does not need to provide code that explicitly creates these threads: they are provided by the runtime or the Swing framework. The programmer's job is to utilize these threads to create a responsive, maintainable Swing program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any other program running on the Java platform, a Swing program can create additional threads and thread pools, using the tools described in the Concurrency lesson. But for basic Swing programs the threads described here are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson discusses each of the three kinds of threads in turn. Worker threads require the most discussion because tasks that run on them are created using javax.swing.SwingWorker. This class has many useful features, including communication and coordination between worker thread tasks and the tasks on other threads.\n"

    "### Initial Threads\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/initial.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Every program has a set of threads where the application logic begins (kp: called initial threads). In **standard programs** (kp: == stand-alone/desktop apps/programs??), there's only one such thread: **the thread that invokes the main method of the program class**. In applets the initial threads are the ones that construct the applet object and invoke its **init** and **start** methods; these actions may occur on a single thread, or on two or three different threads, depending on the Java platform implementation. In this lesson, we call these threads the initial threads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In Swing programs, the initial threads don't have a lot to do. Their most essential job is to create a Runnable object (that initializes the GUI) and schedule that object for execution on the event dispatch thread.** Once the GUI is created, the program is primarily driven by GUI events, each of which causes the execution of a short task on the event dispatch thread. **Application code can schedule additionals tasks on the event dispatch thread (if they complete quickly, so as not to interfere with event processing) or a worker thread (for long-running tasks)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An initial thread schedules the GUI creation task by invoking [javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeLater](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html#invokeLater-java.lang.Runnable-) or [javax.swing.SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html#invokeAndWait-java.lang.Runnable-). Both of these methods take a single argument: the Runnable (kp: the Runnable object) that defines the new task. Their only difference is indicated by their names: invokeLater simply schedules the task and returns; invokeAndWait waits for the task to finish before returning.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see examples of this throughout the Swing tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "    SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {\n",
    "        public void run() {\n",
    "            createAndShowGUI();\n",
    "        }\n",
    "    });\n",
    "\n",
    "**In an applet, the GUI-creation task must be launched from the init method using invokeAndWait;** otherwise, init may return before the GUI is created, which may cause problems for a web browser launching an applet. In any other kind of program (kp: i.e non-applet or standard programs), scheduling the GUI-creation task is usually the last thing _(kp: perhaps the only task, most of the times, for a GUI driven program)_ the initial thread does, so it doesn't matter whether it uses invokeLater or invokeAndWait.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why does not the initial thread simply create the GUI itself? Because almost all code that creates or interacts with Swing components must run on the event dispatch thread.** This restriction is discussed further in the next section (on the Event Dispatch Thread)."

    "### The Event Dispatch Thread\n",
    "\n",
    "Swing event handling code runs on a special thread known as the event dispatch thread. Most code that invokes Swing methods also runs on this thread. This is necessary because most Swing object methods are not \"thread safe\": invoking them from multiple threads risks [thread interference](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/interfere.html) or [memory consistency errors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/concurrency/memconsist.html). Some Swing component methods are labelled \"thread safe\" in the API specification; these can be safely invoked from any thread. All other Swing component methods must be invoked from the event dispatch thread. Programs that ignore this rule may function correctly most of the time, but are subject to unpredictable errors that are difficult to reproduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's useful to think of the code running on the event dispatch thread as a series of short tasks. Most tasks are invocations of event-handling methods, such as ActionListener.actionPerformed. Other tasks can be scheduled by application code, using invokeLater or invokeAndWait. Tasks on the event dispatch thread must finish quickly; if they don't, unhandled events back up and the user interface becomes unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to determine whether your code is running on the event dispatch thread, invoke [javax.swing.SwingUtilities.isEventDispatchThread](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/javax/swing/SwingUtilities.html#isEventDispatchThread--).\n"

    "\n",
    "When a Swing program needs to execute a long-running task, it usually uses one of the worker threads, also known as the background threads. Each task running on a worker thread is represented by an instance of javax.swing.SwingWorker. SwingWorker itself is an abstract class; you must define a subclass in order to create a SwingWorker object; anonymous inner classes are often useful for creating very simple SwingWorker objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "SwingWorker provides a number of communication and control features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The SwingWorker subclass can define a method, done, which is automatically invoked on the event dispatch thread when the background task is finished.\n",
    "* SwingWorker implements java.util.concurrent.Future. This interface allows the background task to provide a return value to the other thread. Other methods in this interface allow cancellation of the background task and discovering whether the background task has finished or been cancelled.\n",
    "* The background task can provide intermediate results by invoking SwingWorker.publish, causing SwingWorker.process to be invoked from the event dispatch thread.\n",
    "* The background task can define bound properties. Changes to these properties trigger events, causing event-handling methods to be invoked on the event dispatch thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are discussed in the following subsections.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The javax.swing.SwingWorker class was added to the Java platform in Java SE 6. Prior to this, another class, also called SwingWorker, was widely used for some of the same purposes. The old SwingWorker was not part of the Java platform specification, and was not provided as part of the JDK.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new javax.swing.SwingWorker is a completely new class. Its functionality is not a strict superset of the old SwingWorker. Methods in the two classes that have the same function do not have the same names. Also, instances of the old SwingWorker class were reusable, while a new instance of javax.swing.SwingWorker is needed for each new background task.\n",

    "Let's start with a task that is very simple, but potentially time-consuming. The TumbleItem applet loads a set of graphic files used in an animation. If the graphic files are loaded from an initial thread, there may be a delay before the GUI appears. If the graphic files are loaded from the event dispatch thread, the GUI may be temporarily unresponsive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid these problems, TumbleItem creates and executes an instance of SwingWorker from its initial threads. The object's doInBackground method, executing in a worker thread, loads the images into an ImageIcon array, and returns a reference to it. Then the done method, executing in the event dispatch thread, invokes get to retrieve this reference, which it assigns to an applet class field named imgs. This allows TumbleItem to construct the GUI immediately, without waiting for the images to finish loading.\n",

SwingWorker's second type parameter specifies a type for interim results returned while the background task is still active. Since this example doesn't return interim results, Void is used as a placeholder.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may wonder if the code that sets imgs is unnecessarily complicated. Why make doInBackground return an object and use done to retrieve it? Why not just have doInBackground set imgs directly? The problem is that the object imgs refers to is created in the worker thread and used in the event dispatch thread. When objects are shared between threads in this way, you must make sure that changes made in one thread are visible to the other. Using get guarantees this, because using get creates a happens before relationship between the code that creates imgs and the code that uses it. For more on the happens before relationship, refer to Memory Consistency Errors in the Concurrency lesson.\n",

    "In Swing, the class that holds your user interface components is called a frame and is defined by the JFrame class. **(kp: In line with the theter metaphor used in JavaFX, we may say that Swing uses the metaphor of a Painter's Frame (with at least 3 legs or stiched on a wall) and a Canvas (for JPanel) attached to it.)** A frame is essentially an empty window to which you can add a panel, which serves as a container for your user-interface elements. A panel is defined by the JPanel class.\n",

    "A Swing application is actually a class that extends the JFrame class. To display user-interface components, you add components to a JPanel and then add the panel to the frame.\n",

    "**JavaFX uses the metaphor of a theater** to model the top-level containers of an application. A stage (defined by the Stage class) represents the highest level container — typically, a window, but on some operating systems, the stage may represent the entire display surface. The individual controls and other components that make up the user interface are contained in a scene (defined by the Scene class). An application can have more than one scene, but only one of the scenes can be displayed on the stage at any given time.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scene contains a scene graph, which is the most important concept in JavaFX. The scene graph is a collection of all the elements that make up a user interface — groups, layouts, controls, and shapes. These objects are called nodes and are all derived from the Node class. The Node class has many useful features and capabilities that are automatically made available to any object you can add to your user interface. For example, the Node class defines a setRotate method that allows you to rotate any node in the scene graph. \n",

To improve performance, JIT compilers interact with the JVM at run time and compile appropriate bytecode sequences into native machine code. When using a JIT compiler, the hardware can execute the native code, as opposed to having the JVM interpret the same sequence of bytecode repeatedly and incurring the penalty of a relatively lengthy translation process. This can lead to performance gains in the execution speed, unless methods are executed less frequently. The time that a JIT compiler takes to compile the bytecode is added to the overall execution time, and could lead to a higher execution time than an interpreter for executing the bytecode if the methods that are compiled by the JIT are not invoked frequently. The JIT compiler performs certain optimizations when compiling the bytecode to native code. Since the JIT compiler translates a series of bytecode into native instructions, it can perform some simple optimizations. Some of the common optimizations performed by JIT compilers are data-analysis, translation from stack operations to register operations, reduction of memory accesses by register allocation, elimination of common sub-expressions etc. The higher the degree of optimization done by a JIT compiler, the more time it spends in the execution stage. Therefore a JIT compiler cannot afford to do all the optimizations that is done by a static compiler, both because of the overhead added to the execution time and because it has only a restricted view of the program."

    "## Virtual Machine\n",
    "In computing, a virtual machine (VM) is an emulation of a computer system. Virtual machines are based on computer architectures and provide functionality of a physical computer. Their implementations may involve specialized hardware, software, or a combination.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different kinds of virtual machines, each with different functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "System virtual machines (also termed full virtualization VMs) provide a substitute for a real machine. They provide functionality needed to execute entire operating systems. A hypervisor uses native execution to share and manage hardware, allowing for multiple environments which are isolated from one another, yet exist on the same physical machine. Modern hypervisors use hardware-assisted virtualization, virtualization-specific hardware, primarily from the host CPUs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "Process virtual machines are designed to execute computer programs in a platform-independent environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some virtual machines, such as QEMU, are designed to also emulate different architectures and allow execution of software applications and operating systems written for another CPU or architecture. Operating-system-level virtualization allows the resources of a computer to be partitioned via the kernel's support for multiple isolated user space instances, which are usually called containers and may look and feel like real machines to the end users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System virtual machines\n",
    "See also: Hardware virtualization and Comparison of platform virtualization software\n",
    "\n",
    "The desire to run multiple operating systems was the initial motive for virtual machines, so as to allow time-sharing among several single-tasking operating systems. In some respects, a system virtual machine can be considered a generalization of the concept of virtual memory that historically preceded it. IBM's CP/CMS, the first systems to allow full virtualization, implemented time sharing by providing each user with a single-user operating system, the Conversational Monitor System (CMS). Unlike virtual memory, a system virtual machine entitled the user to write privileged instructions in their code. This approach had certain advantages, such as adding input/output devices not allowed by the standard system.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "As technology evolves virtual memory for purposes of virtualization, new systems of memory overcommitment may be applied to manage memory sharing among multiple virtual machines on one computer operating system. It may be possible to share memory pages that have identical contents among multiple virtual machines that run on the same physical machine, what may result in mapping them to the same physical page by a technique termed Kernel SamePage Merging. This is especially useful for read-only pages, such as those holding code segments, which is the case for multiple virtual machines running the same or similar software, software libraries, web servers, middleware components, etc. The guest operating systems do not need to be compliant with the host hardware, thus making it possible to run different operating systems on the same computer (e.g., Windows, Linux, or prior versions of an operating system) to support future software.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The use of virtual machines to support separate guest operating systems is popular in regard to embedded systems. A typical use would be to run a real-time operating system simultaneously with a preferred complex operating system, such as Linux or Windows. Another use would be for novel and unproven software still in the developmental stage, so it runs inside a sandbox. Virtual machines have other advantages for operating system development, and may include improved debugging access and faster reboots.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple VMs running their own guest operating system are frequently engaged for server consolidation.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process virtual machines\n",
    "See also: Application virtualization, Runtime system, and Comparison of application virtualization software\n",
    "\n",
    "A process VM, sometimes called an application virtual machine, or Managed Runtime Environment (MRE), runs as a normal application inside a host OS and supports a single process. It is created when that process is started and destroyed when it exits. Its purpose is to provide a platform-independent programming environment that abstracts away details of the underlying hardware or operating system, and allows a program to execute in the same way on any platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process VM provides a high-level abstraction – that of a high-level programming language (compared to the low-level ISA abstraction of the system VM). Process VMs are implemented using an interpreter; performance comparable to compiled programming languages can be achieved by the use of just-in-time compilation.[citation needed]\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of VM has become popular with the Java programming language, which is implemented using the Java virtual machine. Other examples include the Parrot virtual machine, and the .NET Framework, which runs on a VM called the Common Language Runtime. All of them can serve as an abstraction layer for any computer language.\n",
    "\n",
    "A special case of process VMs are systems that abstract over the communication mechanisms of a (potentially heterogeneous) computer cluster. Such a VM does not consist of a single process, but one process per physical machine in the cluster. They are designed to ease the task of programming concurrent applications by letting the programmer focus on algorithms rather than the communication mechanisms provided by the interconnect and the OS. They do not hide the fact that communication takes place, and as such do not attempt to present the cluster as a single machine.[citation needed]\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other process VMs, these systems do not provide a specific programming language, but are embedded in an existing language; typically such a system provides bindings for several languages (e.g., C and Fortran).[citation needed] Examples are Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) and Message Passing Interface (MPI). They are not strictly virtual machines, as the applications running on top still have access to all OS services, and are therefore not confined to the system model."

    "Translation/Interpretation | No translation/interpretation | takes bytecode and produces machine code appropriate for the actual machine the VM is running on.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Code\n",
    "Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical machine code  may be regarded as the lowest-level representation of a compiled and/or assembled computer program or as a primitive and hardware-dependent programming language. While it is possible to write programs directly in numerical machine code, it is tedious and error prone to manage individual bits and calculate numerical addresses and constants manually. It is therefore rarely done today, except for situations that require extreme optimization or debugging.\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost all practical programs today are written in higher-level languages or assembly language, and translated to executable machine code by a compiler and/or assembler and linker. Programs in interpreted languages[1] are not translated into machine code however, although their interpreter (which may be seen as an executor or processor) typically consists of directly executable machine code (generated from assembly and/or high level language source code).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bytecode\n",
    " Byte code, also known as p-code (portable code), is a form of [instruction set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture) designed for efficient execution by a software interpreter. Unlike human-readable source code, byte codes are compact numeric codes, constants, and references (normally numeric addresses) which encode the result of parsing and semantic analysis of things like type, scope, and nesting depths of program objects. They therefore allow much better performance than direct interpretation of source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name byte code stems from instruction sets which have one-byte op codes followed by optional parameters. Intermediate representations such as byte code may be output by programming language implementations to ease interpretation, or it may be used to reduce hardware and operating system dependence by allowing the same code to run on different platforms. Byte code may often be either directly executed on a virtual machine (i.e. interpreter), or it may be further compiled into machine code for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    " Since byte code instructions are processed by software, they may be arbitrarily complex, but are nonetheless often akin to traditional hardware instructions; [virtual stack machines are](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_machine) the most common, but [virtual register machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Register_machine) have also been built. Different parts may often be stored in separate files, similar to object modules, but dynamically loaded during execution."

    "In computer science, computer engineering and programming language implementations, a stack machine is a type of computer. In some cases, the term refers to a software scheme that simulates a stack machine. The main difference from other computers is that most of its instructions operate on a pushdown stack of numbers rather than numbers in registers. A stack computer is programmed with a reverse Polish notation instruction set. Most computer systems implement a stack in some form to pass parameters and link to subroutines. This does not make these computers stack machines.\n",

Although they all look similar and as a programmer we don’t care about these concepts a lot, but they are different and meant for specific purposes. It’s one of the common [java interview questions](https://www.journaldev.com/java-interview-questions) and this article will explain each one of these and what is the difference between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### JDK\n",
    "\n",
    "Java Development Kit is the core component of Java Environment and provides all the tools, executables and binaries required to compile, debug and execute a Java Program. JDK is a platform specific software and thats why we have separate installers for Windows, Mac and Unix systems. We can say that JDK is superset of JRE since it contains JRE with Java compiler, debugger and core classes. Current version of JDK is 1.7 also known as Java 7.\n",
    "### JVM\n",
    "\n",
    "JVM is the heart of java programming language. When we run a program, JVM is responsible to converting Byte code to the machine specific code. JVM is also platform dependent and provides core java functions like memory management, garbage collection, security etc. JVM is customizable and we can use java options to customize it, for example allocating minimum and maximum memory to JVM. JVM is called virtual because it provides a interface that does not depend on the underlying operating system and machine hardware. This independence from hardware and operating system is what makes java program write-once run-anywhere.\n",

    "JRE is the implementation of JVM, it provides platform to execute java programs. JRE consists of JVM and java binaries and other classes to execute any program successfully.

    "### The Structure of the Java Virtual Machine \n",
    "This document specifies an abstract machine. It does not describe any particular implementation of the Java Virtual Machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement the Java Virtual Machine correctly, you need only be able to read the class file format and correctly perform the operations specified therein. Implementation details that are not part of the Java Virtual Machine's specification would unnecessarily constrain the creativity of implementors. For example, the memory layout of run-time data areas, the garbage-collection algorithm used, and any internal optimization of the Java Virtual Machine instructions (for example, translating them into machine code) are left to the discretion of the implementor.\n",

    "All references to Unicode in this specification are given with respect to The Unicode Standard, Version 6.0.0, available at http://www.unicode.org/. \n",
    "### The class File Format\n",
    "\n",
    "Compiled code to be executed by the Java Virtual Machine is represented using a hardware- and operating system-independent binary format, typically (but not necessarily) stored in a file, known as the class file format. The class file format precisely defines the representation of a class or interface, including details such as byte ordering that might be taken for granted in a platform-specific object file format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chapter 4, \"The class File Format\", covers the class file format in detail. \n",
    "### Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the Java programming language, the Java Virtual Machine operates on two kinds of types: primitive types and reference types. There are, correspondingly, two kinds of values that can be stored in variables, passed as arguments, returned by methods, and operated upon: primitive values and reference values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java Virtual Machine expects that nearly all type checking is done prior to run time, typically by a compiler, and does not have to be done by the Java Virtual Machine itself. Values of primitive types need not be tagged or otherwise be inspectable to determine their types at run time, or to be distinguished from values of reference types. Instead, the instruction set of the Java Virtual Machine distinguishes its operand types using instructions intended to operate on values of specific types. For instance, iadd, ladd, fadd, and dadd are all Java Virtual Machine instructions that add two numeric values and produce numeric results, but each is specialized for its operand type: int, long, float, and double, respectively. For a summary of type support in the Java Virtual Machine instruction set, see [§2.11.1](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-2.html#jvms-2.11.1).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java Virtual Machine contains explicit support for objects. An object is either a dynamically allocated class instance or an array. A reference to an object is considered to have Java Virtual Machine type reference. Values of type reference can be thought of as pointers to objects. More than one reference to an object may exist. Objects are always operated on, passed, and tested via values of type reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Primitive Types and Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The primitive data types supported by the Java Virtual Machine are the numeric types, the boolean type (§2.3.4), and the returnAddress type (§2.3.3).\n",
    "\n",
    "The numeric types consist of the integral types (§2.3.1) and the floating-point types (§2.3.2).\n",

    " * byte, whose values are 8-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\n",

    " * short, whose values are 16-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\n",
    "\n",
    " * int, whose values are 32-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\n",
    "\n",
    " * long, whose values are 64-bit signed two's-complement integers, and whose default value is zero\n",

    " * char, whose values are 16-bit unsigned integers representing Unicode code points in the Basic Multilingual Plane, encoded with UTF-16, and whose default value is the null code point ('\\u0000')\n",
    "\n",
    "The floating-point types are:\n",
    "\n",
    " * float, whose values are elements of the float value set or, where supported, the float-extended-exponent value set, and whose default value is positive zero\n",
    "\n",
    " * double, whose values are elements of the double value set or, where supported, the double-extended-exponent value set, and whose default value is positive zero\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the boolean type encode the truth values true and false, and the default value is false.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Java Virtual Machine Specification, First Edition did not consider boolean to be a Java Virtual Machine type. However, boolean values do have limited support in the Java Virtual Machine. The Java Virtual Machine Specification, Second Edition clarified the issue by treating boolean as a type.\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the returnAddress type are pointers to the opcodes of Java Virtual Machine instructions. Of the primitive types, only the returnAddress type is not directly associated with a Java programming language type. "

    "Comparison Index |  Class Based | Protypal/Protype Based \n",
    "----- | ------ | ----\n",
    "Definition | From Ref2: Class-based programming, or more commonly class-orientation, is a style of object-oriented programming (OOP) in which inheritance is achieved by defining classes of objects, as opposed to the objects themselves (compare prototype-based programming). | From Ref3: Prototype-based programming is a style of object-oriented programming in which behaviour reuse (known as inheritance) is performed via a process of reusing existing objects via delegation that serve as prototypes. This model can also be known as prototypal, prototype-oriented, classless, or instance-based programming. Delegation is the language feature that supports prototype-based programming.\n",
    "Popularity & maturity | Most popular and developed OOP model | Less popular and developed\n",
    "More detail (still this paradigm has grown increasingly popular since the late 1990s) | In this model, objects are entities that combine state (i.e. data), behavior (i.e. procedures, or methods) and identity (unique existence among all other objects). The structure and behavior of an object are defined by a class, which is a definition, or blueprint, of all objects of a specific type. An object must be explicitly created based on a class and an object thus created is considered to be an instance of that class. An object is similar to a structure, with the addition of method pointers, member access control, and an implicit data member which locates instances of the class (i.e. actual objects of that class) in the class hierarchy (essential for runtime inheritance features). | Prototype object oriented programming uses generalized objects, which can then be cloned and extended. Using fruit as an example, a \"fruit\" object would represent the properties and functionality of fruit in general. A \"banana\" object would be cloned from the \"fruit\" object, and would also be extended to include general properties specific to bananas. Each individual \"banana\" object would be cloned from the generic \"banana\" object. Compare to the class-based paradigm, where a \"fruit\" class (not object) would be extended by a \"banana\" class.\n",
    "Programming Languagues using these models | Although [**Simula**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula) introduced the class abstraction, the canonical example of a class-based language is [**Smalltalk**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smalltalk). Others include **C++, Java, C#, Python, Julia??, PHP, Objective-C, ..**| [**Self**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self_(programming_language)), **JavaScript (and other ECMAScript implementations such as JScript & Flash's ActionScript 1.0), Lua, Cecil, NewtonScript, lo, loke, MOO, REBOL, Lisaac and AHk**. \n",
    "Type System | .. | Almost all prototype-based systems are based on interpreted and dynamically typed languages. Systems based on statically typed languages are technically feasible, however. The Omega language discussed in Prototype-Based Programming[3] is an example of such a system, though according to Omega's website even Omega is not exclusively static, but rather its \"compiler may choose to use static binding where this is possible and may improve the efficiency of a program.\"\n",
    "Inheritance | In class-based programming, inheritance is done by defining new classes as extensions of existing classes: the existing class is the parent class and the new class is the child class. If a child class has only one parent class, this is known as single inheritance, while if a child class can have more than one parent class, this is known as multiple inheritance. This organizes classes into a hierarchy, either a tree (if single inheritance) or lattice (if multiple inheritance).  `........`    The defining feature of inheritance is that both interface and implementation are inherited; if only interface is inherited, this is known as interface inheritance or subtyping. Inheritance can also be done without classes, as in prototype-based programming. | Prototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as: \"you make prototype objects, and then … make new instances.

    "\n",
    "    In JavaScript, every object is at the same time an instance and a class. To do inheritance, you can use any object instance as a prototype.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In Python, C++, etc.. there are classes, and instances, as separate concepts. In order to do inheritance, you have to use the base class to create a new class, which can then be used to produce derived instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Why did JavaScript go in this direction (prototype-based object orientation)? what are the advantages (and disadvantages) of prototype-based OO with respect to traditional, class-based OO?\n",
    "\n",
    "A1:\n",
    "* JavaScript was influenced by Self which was the first language with prototypal inheritance. At that time classical inheritance was all the rage, first introduced in Simula. However classical inheritance was too complicated. Then David Ungar and Randall Smith had an epiphany after reading GEB - \"The most specific event can serve as a general example of a class of events.\" They realized that classes are not required for object-oriented programming. Hence Self was born. To know how prototypal inheritance is better than classical inheritance read this: stackoverflow.com/a/16872315/783743 =) – Aadit M Shah Jun 2 '13 at 3:30\n",

    "\n",
    "There are about a hundred terminology issues here, mostly built around someone (not you) trying to make their idea sound like The Best.\n",
    "\n",
    "All object oriented languages need to be able to deal with several concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **encapsulation** of data along with associated operations on the data, variously known as data members and member functions, or as data and methods, among other things.\n",
    "* **inheritance**, the ability to say that these objects are just like that other set of objects EXCEPT for these changes\n",
    "* **polymorphism (\"many shapes\")** in which an object decides for itself what methods are to be run, so that you can depend on the language to route your requests correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as far as comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "First thing is the whole \"class\" vs \"prototype\" question. The idea originally began in Simula, where with a class-based method each class represented a set of objects that shared the same state space (read \"possible values\") and the same operations, thereby forming an equivalence class. If you look back at Smalltalk, since you can open a class and add methods, this is effectively the same as what you can do in Javascript.\n",
    "\n",
    "Later OO languages wanted to be able to use static type checking, so we got the notion of a fixed class set at compile time. In the open-class version, you had more flexibility; in the newer version, you had the ability to check some kinds of correctness at the compiler that would otherwise have required testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a \"class-based\" language, that copying happens at compile time. In a prototype language, the operations are stored in the prototype data structure, which is copied and modified at run time. Abstractly, though, a class is still the equivalence class of all objects that share the same state space and methods. When you add a method to the prototype, you're effectively making an element of a new equivalence class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, why do that? primarily because it makes for a simple, logical, elegant mechanism at run time. now, to create a new object, or to create a new class, you simply have to perform a deep copy, copying all the data and the prototype data structure. You get inheritance and polymorphism more or less for free then: method lookup always consists of asking a dictionary for a method implementation by name.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason that ended up in Javascript/ECMA script is basically that when we were getting started with this 10 years ago, we were dealing with much less powerful computers and much less sophisticated browsers. Choosing the prototype-based method meant the interpreter could be very simple while preserving the desirable properties of object orientation.\n",

    "**Memory leaks** | .. | **Garbage collection means memory leaks are much harder to cause in Java, but not impossible.** However, many memory leaks and resouce leaks may be tracked to a badly written finalize( ) or not releasing a resource at the end of the block where it is allocated (a place where a destructor would certainly come in handy). The **garbage collector is a huge improvement over C++, and makes a lot of programming problems simply vanish**. It may make Java unsuitable for solving a small subset of problems that cannot tolerate a garbage collector, but the advantage of a garbage collector seems to greatly outweigh this potential drawback. \n",

Also has structs, enumeratations & unions.  | **Everything must be in a class.** No global functions or global data. Equivalent of globals achieved through static methods and static data within a class. No structs or enumerations or unions. Only classes. \n",
    "**Class: Methods of a Class** | Methods can be either [inlined](http://www.cplusplus.com/articles/2LywvCM9/) or defined outside the body of the class. Thus, in C++ it would look like all the functions are inlined, but they’re not (inlines are noted later).  | All method definitions are defined in the body of the class. \n",
    "**Class: Closing semicolon in Class definition** | Yes | No. As a result, there are no class declarations of the form **class foo;** only class definitions. `        class aType { void aMethod( ) { /* method body */ } }`\n",
    "**Class: Multiple inheritance** | supports | No support through class but achieved by interfaces. ` ........ ` From ref3: Java doesn’t provide multiple inheritance (MI), at least not in the same sense C++ does. Like protected, MI seems like a good idea but you know you need it only when you are face to face with the right design problem. Since Java uses a singly-rooted hierarchy, you’ll probably run into fewer situations where MI is necessary. The aforementioned interface keyword takes care of combining multiple interfaces. \n",
    "**Class: Inheritance tree** | Always creates a new inheritance tree | Uses single inheritance tree always because all classes are the child of Object class in Java. Object class is the root of inheritance tree in Java. [Class Object is the root of the class hierarchy. Every class has Object as a superclass. All objects, including arrays, implement the methods of this class.](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Object.html)\n",
    "**Class: Inheritance tree2** | .. | Java uses a singly-rooted hierarchy, so all objects are ultimately inherited from the root class Object. In C++ you can start a new inheritance tree anywhere, so you end up with a forest of trees. In Java you get a single ultimate hierarchy. This can seem restrictive, but it gives a great deal of power since you know that every object is guaranteed to have at least the Object interface. **C++ appears to be the only OO language that does not impose a singly-rooted hierarchy**. \n",
    "**Class: Inheritance 3** | .. | **Inheritance in Java has the same effect as in C++, but the syntax is different. Java uses the extends keyword to indicate inheritance** from a base class, and **the super keyword to specify methods to be called in the base class** that have the same name as the method you’re in (however, the super keyword in Java allows you to access methods **only in the parent class, one level up** _(kp: i.e. only in parent, but not in grandparent or above it)_ in the hierarchy. **Base-class scoping in C++ allows you to access methods that are deeper in the hierarchy**). The base-class constructor is also called using the super keyword. As mentioned before, all classes are ultimately, automatically inherited from Object. There’s no explicit constructor initializer list like in C++ but the compiler forces you to perform all base-class initialization at the beginning of the constructor body and it won’t let you perform these later in the body. Member initialization is guaranteed through a combination of automatic initialization and exceptions for uninitialized object handles (see [here](#exampleInheritance3)).\n",
    "**Class, Inheritance4: interface, abstract** | .. | Java provides the interface keyword which creates the equivalent of an abstract base class filled with abstract methods and with no data members. This makes a clear distinction between something designed to be just an interface versus an extension of existing functionality using the extends keyword. It’s worth noting that the **abstract keyword produces a similar effect, in that you can’t create an object of that class.** However, an abstract class may contain abstract methods but it can also contain implementations, so it is restricted to single inheritance. Together with interfaces, this scheme prevents the need for some mechanism like virtual base classes in C++. To create a version of the interface that can be instantiated, you use the implements keyword, whose syntax looks like inheritance (see [here](#exampleInheritance4)).\n",
    "**Class: scope resolution operator** | Since class methods can be defined outside the class body as well, and many different classes can have methods with the same names, one has to use some operator for scope resolution, and that operator in case of C++ is :: | **There’s no scope resolution operator :: in Java**. Java **uses the dot for everything**, but **can get away with it since you can define elements only within a class**. Even the method definitions must always occur within a class so there is no need for scope resolution there, either. One place where **you’ll notice the difference is in the calling of static methods: you say ClassName.methodName( );**. _(kp: I think, all the objects of a given class will have the same instance of the static method, therefore, we use_ **ClassName.methodName()**. _In fact, [this c++ article](http://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/812-static-member-functions/) says the following:_ **\"_static member variables, you learned that static member variables are member variables that belong to the class rather than objects of the class_.**\") \n",
    "**Primitive types** | .. |  Java, like C++, **has primitive types for efficient access**. In Java, these are **boolean, char, byte , short, int, long, float, and double**. All the primitive types **have specified sizes that are machine-independent for portability** (this must have some impact on performance, varying with the machine). **Type-checking and type requirements are much tighter in Java. For example: A. Conditional expressions can be only boolean, not integral B**. The **result of an expression like X + Y must be used**; you can’t just say “X + Y” for the side effect. \n",
    "**char type** | .. | The char type uses the international 16-bit Unicode character set, so it can automatically represent most national characters.\n",
    "**String type** | kp: There is a String class in C++ (thus objects) which can hold quoted strings such as `String str = \"I am a String object\";`. But, there is independent static character array string too (both in C/C++) which goes as `char str[] = \"I am a string too\";` i.e. an array of primitive type 'char'.| Static quoted **strings are automatically converted into String objects** (kp: immutable objects). There is **no independent static character array string as there is in C/C++**. \n",
    "**Arrays** | .. | Arrays are quite different in Java. There’s a read-only length member that tells you how big the array is, and run-time checking throws an exception if you go out of bounds. All arrays are created on the heap, and you can assign one array to another (the array handle is simply copied). The array identifier itself is a first-class object, with all the methods commonly available to all other objects. \n",
    "**Non-primitive type creation** | .. | All objects of non-primitive types can be created only via new. There’s no equivalent to creating non-primitive objects “on the stack” as in C++. All primitive types can be created only on the stack, without new. There are wrapper classes for all primitive classes so you can create equivalent heap-based objects with new. (Arrays of primitives are a special case: they can be allocated via aggregate initialization as in C++, or by using new). \n",
    "**Forward declarations of classes and methods** | A class or method must be declared first (forward or above or at the top) before it can be used. That's the reason why we put include statements at the top (or above the point where it is called or used). | No forward declarations are necessary in Java. If you want to use a class or a method before it is defined in, you simply use it – the compiler ensures that the appropriate definition exists. Thus you don’t have any of the forward referencing issues that you do in C++. \n",
    "**Preprocessors** | .. | Java has no preprocessor. If you want to use classes in another library, you say import and the name of the library. There are no preprocessor-like macros. \n",
    "**Namespaces** | .. | **Java uses packages in place of namespaces.** The name issue is taken care of by (1) putting everything in a class and (2) a facility called “packages” that performs the equivalent namespace breakup for class names. Packages also collect library components under a single library name. You simply import a package and the compiler takes care of the rest. \n",
    "**Initialization of object handles defined as class members** | .. | Object handles defined as class members are automatically initialized to null. Initialization of primitive class data members is guaranteed in Java; if you don’t explicitly initialize them they get a default value (a zero or equivalent). You can initialize them directly when you define them in the class, or you can do it in the constructor. The syntax makes more sense than C++, and is consistent for static and non-static members alike. You don’t need to externally define storage for static members like you do in C++. \n",
    "**Goto statement** | supports | **Doesn't support.** The one unconditional jump mechanism is the break label or continue label, which is used to jump out of the middle of multiply-nested loops. \n",
    "**Pointers** | supports. can write pointer program | Supports internally, but can't write the pointer program - means Java has a restricted pointer support\n",
    "**Pointers more** | .. | There are no Java pointers in the sense of C and C++. When you create an object with new, you get back a reference (which I’ve been calling a handle in this book). For example: String s = new String(“howdy”); However, unlike C++ references that must be initialized when created and cannot be rebound to a different location, Java references don’t have to be bound at the point of creation, and they can be rebound at will, which eliminates part of the need for pointers. The other reason for pointers is to select any place in memory (which makes them unsafe, which is why Java doesn’t support them). Pointers are often seen as an efficient way to move through an array of primitive variables; Java arrays allow you to do that in a safer fashion. The final solution for pointer problems is native methods (discussed in Appendix A). Passing pointers to methods isn’t a problem since there are no global functions, only classes, and you can pass references to objects. The Java language promoters initially said “no pointers!” but when many programmers questioned “how can you work without pointers?” they began saying “restricted pointers.” You can make up your mind whether it’s “really” a pointer or not. In any event, there’s no pointer arithmetic. \n",
    "**Copy Constructors** | .. |  Java has constructors, similar to constructors in C++. You get a default constructor if you don’t define one, and if you define a non-default constructor, there’s no automatic default constructor defined for you, just like C++. There are no copy-constructors, since all arguments are passed by reference.\n",
    "**Destructors** | Uses destructors | **No destructors in Java** classes. There is **no “scope” of a variable per se, to indicate when the object’s lifetime is ended – the lifetime of an object is determined instead by the garbage collector**. There is **a finalize( ) method that’s a member of each class, like a destructor, but finalize( ) is called by the garbage collector and is supposed to be responsible only for releasing resources**. If you need something done at a specific point, you must create a special method and call it, not rely upon finalize( ). Put another way, all objects in C++ will be (or rather, should be) destroyed, but not all objects in Java are garbage collected. Because Java doesn’t support destructors, you must be careful to create a cleanup method if necessary, and to explicitly call all the cleanup methods for the base class and member objects in your class. \n",
    "**Templates & Collections** | supports | **Java has no templates or other implementation of parameterized types**. There is a **set of collections: Vector, Stack and Hashtable that hold Object references**, and through which you can satisfy your collection needs, but these collections are not designed for efficiency like the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). For a more complete set of collections, there’s a freely-available library called the Generic Collection Library for Java (www.ObjectSpace.com) which shows signs of eventually being incorporated into the standard Java language. \n",
    "**Compiler & Interpreter** | uses compiler only (kp: which converts the source code to native/machine code ((language of) instruction set (architechture)), thus enabling it to talk to the Machine directly) | Uses both compiler & interpreter (kp: Compiler converts the source to the virtual-machine (JVM) code or the java-bytecode) and the JVM talks to the Machine using the interpreter (+JIT compiled native code as well))\n",
    "**Speed or Performance** [Ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_performance) | **Very fast** because the compiled **programs run directly on the computer's processor as native code** rather than on a VM |Early JVMs always interpreted Java bytecodes. This had a large **performance penalty of between a factor 10 and 20 for Java versus C** in average applications.[5] To combat this, a **just-in-time (JIT) compiler was introduced into Java 1.1 (in 1997)**. Due to the high cost of compiling, **an added system called HotSpot** was introduced in Java 1.2 and was made the default in Java 1.3. Using this framework, the Java virtual machine continually analyses program performance for hot spots which are executed frequently or repeatedly. These are then targeted for optimizing, leading to high performance execution with a minimum of overhead for less performance-critical code.[6][7] **Some benchmarks show a 10-fold speed gain** by this means.[8] However, **due to time constraints, the compiler cannot fully optimize the program, and thus the resulting program is slower than native code alternatives.**[9][10] **Hardware execution of Java bytecode,** such as that offered by ARM's [Jazelle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazelle), can also offer significant performance improvements.\n",
    "**Function overloading** | .. | Java has method overloading that works virtually identically to C++ function overloading. \n",
    "**Default arguments** | .. (support??) | Java does not support default arguments. \n",
    "**Call/Pass by Value, reference, & pointer** | supports all three | supports call/pass by value only.\n",
    "**Structures & Unions** | supports both | no support\n",
    "**Standard vs Third party libraries for some specific tasks** | No built-in support. Relies on **non-standard third-party libraries**. | Java contains **(built-in) standard libraries** for solving specific tasks.  These tasks include (or will soon include): – **Networking – Database Connection (via JDBC) – Multithreading – Distributed Objects (via RMI and CORBA) – Compression – Commerce.** The availability and standard nature of these libraries allow for more rapid application development. \n",
    "**Thread (Multi-threading) Support** | doesn't have built-in support. Rather relies on third party  libraries for the support |  **Has built-in thread support.** There’s a Thread class that you inherit to create a new thread (you override the run( ) method). Mutual exclusion occurs at the level of objects using the synchronized keyword as a type qualifier for methods. Only one thread may use a synchronized method of a particular object at any one time. Put another way, when a synchronized method is entered, it first “locks” the object against any other synchronized method using that object, and “unlocks” the object only upon exiting the method. There are no explicit locks; they happen automatically. You’re still responsible for implementing more sophisticated synchronization between threads by creating your own “monitor” class. Recursive synchronized methods work correctly. Time slicing is not guaranteed between equal priority threads. \n",
    "**Access specifiers (public, private & protected)** | .. | Instead of controlling blocks of declarations like C++ does, access specifiers (public, private and protected) are placed on each definition for each member of a class. Without an explicit access specifier, the element defaults to “friendly,” which means it is accessible to other elements in the same package (equivalent to them all being friends) but inaccessible outside the package. The class, and each method within the class, has an access specifier to determine whether it’s visible outside the file. Sometimes the private keyword is used less in Java because “friendly” access is often more useful than excluding access from other classes in the same package (however, with multithreading the proper use of private is essential). The Java protected keyword means “accessible to inheritors and to others in this package.” There is no equivalent to the C++ protected keyword which means “accessible to inheritors only” (private protected used to do this, but it was removed). \n",
    "** Nested classes, inner and outer classes ** | .. | Nested classes. In C++, nesting a class is an aid to name hiding and code organization (but C++ namespaces eliminate the need for name hiding). Java packaging provides the equivalence of namespaces, so that isn't an issue. Java 1.1 has inner classes which look just like nested classes. However, an object of an inner class secretly keeps a handle to the object of the outer class that was involved in the creation of the inner-class object. This means that the inner-class object may access members of the outer-class object without qualification, as if those members belonged directly to the inner-class object. This provides a much more elegant solution to the problem of callbacks, solved with pointers to members in C++. \n",
    "** Pointers to members ** | .. | Because of inner classes described in the previous point, there are no pointers to members in Java. \n",
    "** Inline methods ** | .. | No inline methods. The Java compiler may decide on its own to inline a method, but you don’t have much control over this. You may suggest inlining in Java by using the final keyword for a method. However, inline functions are only suggestions to the C++ compiler, as well. \n",
    "**Documentation comment** | No support | Supports documentation comment (`/** ... */`) allowing javadoc creation.   ` .........` From ref3: Java has built-in support for comment documentation, so the source code file can also contain its own documentation, which is stripped out and reformatted into HTML using a separate program. This is a boon for documentation maintenance and use.\n",
    "**Virtual Keyword** | supports - so that we can decide whether or not to override a function | No virtual keyword, but we can override all non-static methods by default. In other words, non-static methods are virtual by default. `  .........     ` From ref3: There’s no virtual keyword in Java because all non-static methods always use [dynamic binding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_binding). In Java, the programmer doesn’t have to decide whether or not to use dynamic binding. The reason virtual exists in C++ is so you can leave it off for a slight increase in efficiency when you’re tuning for performance (or, put another way, “if you don’t use it you don’t pay for it”), but this often results in confusion and unpleasant surprises. The final keyword provides some latitude for efficiency tuning – it tells the compiler that this method may not be overridden, and thus that it can be statically bound (and made inline, thus using the equivalent of a C++ non-virtual call). These optimizations are up to the compiler. \n",
    "**unsigned right shift >>>** | doesn't support | supports - fills zeroes at the top for the negative numbers. For positive numbers, it works same as with >> operator. (_From [this article](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~renaat/projects/cvjava.html): Java adds the triple right shift >>> to act as a “logical” right shift by inserting zeroes at the top end; the >> inserts the sign bit as it shifts (an “arithmetic” shift). _)\n",
    "** Run-time type identification ** | ... | Run-time type identification functionality is quite similar to C++. To get information about handle X you can say, for example: X.getClass().getName(); To perform a type-safe downcast you say: derived d = (derived)base; just like an old-style C cast. The compiler automatically invokes the dynamic casting mechanism without requiring extra syntax. Although this doesn’t have the benefit of easy location of casts as in C++ “new casts,” Java checks usage and throws exceptions so it doesn’t allow bad casts like C++ does. \n",
    "** Exception handling ** | ... | Exception handling in Java is different because there are no destructors. A finally clause can be added to force execution of statements that perform necessary cleanup. All exceptions in Java are inherited from the base class Throwable, so you’re guaranteed a common interface. (see [example](#exceptionExample1))\n",
    "** Exception specification ** | .... | Exception specifications in Java are vastly superior to those in C++. Instead of the C++ approach of calling a function at run-time when the wrong exception is thrown, Java exception specifications are checked and enforced at compile-time. In addition, overridden methods must conform to the exception specification of the base-class version of that method: they can throw the specified exceptions, or exceptions derived from those. This provides much more robust exception-handling code. \n",
    "** Method & operator overloading ** | There are **both operator & method overloading**. | There is **method overloading**, but **no operator overloading in Java**. The String class does use the + and += operators to concatenate strings and String expressions use automatic type conversion, but that’s a special built-in case. \n",
    "** Pass-by-value (const issues??) ** |  .. | The const issues in C++ are avoided in Java by convention. You pass only handles to objects, and local copies are never made for you automatically. If you want the equivalent of C++’s pass-by-value, you call clone( ) to produce a local copy of the argument (although the clone( ) mechanism is somewhat poorly designed). There’s no copy-constructor that’s automatically called. To create a compile-time constant value, you say: static final int SIZE = 255; static final int BSIZE = 8 * SIZE;\n",
    "** Programming \"Applicaiton\" vs \"applet\"** | ... | Because of security issues, programming an “application” is quite different from programming an “applet.” A significant issue is that an applet won’t let you write to disk, because that would allow a program downloaded from an unknown machine to trash your disk. This changes somewhat with Java 1.1 digital signing, which allows you to unequivocally know everyone that wrote all the programs that have special access to your system (one of which may have trashed your disk; you still have to figure out which one and what to do about it…). \n",
    "** Hardware access ** | ... | Since Java can be too restrictive in some cases, you may be prevented from doing important tasks like directly accessing hardware. Java solves this with native methods that allow you to call a function written in another language (currently only C/C++ are supported). Thus you can always solve a platform-specific problem (in a relatively non-portable fashion, but then that code is isolated). Applets cannot call native methods, only applications. \n",
    "** Java Beans Standard ** | No such thing | Java 1.1 includes the **Java Beans standard**, which is **a way to create components that can be used in visual programming environments**. This promotes visual components that can be used under all vendor’s development environments. Since you aren’t tied to a particular vendor’s design for visual components, this should result in greater selection and availability of components. **In addition, the design for Java Beans is simpler for programmers to understand; vendor-specific component frameworks tend to involve a steeper learning curve**. \n",
    "** Exception thrown for Java handle/reference failure ** | .... | If the access to a Java handle fails, an exception is thrown. This test doesn’t have to occur right before the use of a handle; the Java specification just says that the exception must somehow be thrown. Many C++ runtime systems can also throw exceptions for bad pointers. \n",
    "** Robustness ** | Not so robust | Generally, **Java is more robust**, via: – Object handles initialized to null (a keyword) – Handles are always checked and exceptions are thrown for failures – All array accesses are **checked for bounds violations – Automatic garbage collection prevents memory leaks – Clean, relatively fool-proof exception handling** – Simple language support for multi-threading – **Bytecode verification** of network applets.\n",
    "** Criticism ** | **From Ref6**: **C features** (pointer arithmetic, operator precedence or preprocessor macros), pure C++ features (extensive but not complete backward compatibility with C; Slow complie times; Global format state of `<iostream>`; Heap allocations in containers; Iterators; Uniform initialization syntax; Exceptions; Strings without Unicode; Code bloat;) | **From Ref5:** A number of criticisms have been leveled at the Java programming language and the Java software platform for various design choices in the language and platform. Such criticisms include the implementation of generics, forced object-oriented programming only, the handling of unsigned numbers, the implementation of floating-point arithmetic, and a history of security vulnerabilities in the primary Java VM implementation HotSpot. Additionally, Java, especially its early versions, has been criticized for its performance compared to other programming languages, some of which the Java community (before it was a community) had claimed it would better. Developers have also remarked that differences in various Java implementations must be taken into account when writing complex Java programs that must be used across these implementations.[1]"

    "**Nature of execution** | JS codes are run on browsers only (the codes must (primarily) be placed inside an HTML document to function). JavaScript is text that is fed into a browser that can interpret it and then it is enacted by the browser--although today's web apps are starting to blur the line between traditional desktop applications and those which are created using the traditional web technologies: JavaScript, HTML and CSS. (kp: sentences copied verbatim)| Java applications run in a virtual machine and they can stand on their own. Java is a much larger and more complicated language that creates \"standalone\" applications. A Java \"applet\" (so-called because it is a little application) is a fully contained program. \n",
    "** How the language is presented to the end user** | JavaScript is text-based. You write it to an HTML document and it is run through a browser. You can alter it after it runs and run it again and again. | Java must be compiled into what is known as a \"machine language\" before it can be run on the Web. Basically what happens is after the programmer writes the Java program and checks it for errors, he or she hands the text over to another computer program that changes the text code into a smaller language. That smaller language is formatted so that it is seen by the computer as a set program with definite beginning and ending points. Nothing can be added to it and nothing can be subtracted without destroying the program. Once the Java is compiled, it is set. Sure, you can go back to the original text and alter it, but then you need to compile again.\n",
    "** Role of HTML document in a browser ** | JavaScript is wholly reliant on the browser to understand it and make it come to life. | Java applets run independent of the HTML document that is calling for them (and Java is also what runs many appliances and mobile devices, and does not require a web browser). Sure, they appear on the page, but the HTML document did little more than call for the application and place it. If the programmer allows it, oftentimes parameters can be set by the HTML document. This includes the background color of the applet of the type of text it displays, etc. The delivery of the applet is done through a download. The HTML document calls for the application, it downloads to the user's cache, and waits to run.\n",
    "** They require different plug-ins** | -- | --\n",
    "** Ease of programming ** | Perhaps, JavaScript's main benefit is that it can be understood by the common human. It is much easier and more robust than Java. It allows for fast creation of web page events. Many JavaScript commands are what are known as Event Handlers: They can be embedded right into existing HTML commands. JavaScript is a little more forgiving than Java. It allows more freedom in the creation of objects. JavaScript allows you to call on an item that already exists, like the status bar or the browser itself, and play with just that part. JavaScript is geared to web pages. | Java is very rigid and requires all items to be denoted and spelled out _(kp: strongly typed???)_. Java is geared toward where it is needed most at the time.\n"

    "A thin client is a lightweight computer that has been optimized for remoting into a server-based computing environment. The server does most of the work, which can include launching software programs, crunching numbers, and storing data. In contrast, a conventional desktop PC ([fat client](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fat_client)) typically performs the same tasks locally, but can also remote into a server-based environment when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thin clients occur as components of a broader computing infrastructure, where many clients share their computations with a server or server farm. The server-side infrastructure makes use of cloud computing software such as application virtualization, hosted shared desktop (HSD) or desktop virtualization (VDI). This combination forms what is known as a cloud-based system where desktop resources are centralized at one or more data centers. The benefits of centralization are hardware resource optimization, reduced software maintenance, and improved security.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example of hardware resource optimization: Cabling, bussing and I/O can be minimized while idle memory and processing power can be applied to users sessions that most need it.\n",
    "* Example of reduced software maintenance: Software patching, security updates, application/OS updates, and OS migrations can be applied, tested and activated for all users in one instance to accelerate roll-out and improve administrative efficiency.\n",

    "Thin client hardware generally consists of a computer terminal which provides I/O for a keyboard, mouse, monitor, jacks for sound peripherals, and open ports for USB devices (e.g., printer, flash drive, webcam, card reader, smartphone, etc.). Some thin clients include legacy serial or parallel ports to support older devices such as receipt printers, scales, time clocks, etc. Thin client software typically consists of a GUI (graphical user interface), cloud access agents (e.g., RDP, ICA, PCoIP), a local web browser, terminal emulations (in some cases), and a basic set of local utilities."

    "Java provides the interface keyword which creates the equivalent of an abstract base class filled with abstract methods and with no data members. This makes a clear distinction between something designed to be just an interface versus an extension of existing functionality using the extends keyword. It’s worth noting that the abstract keyword produces a similar effect, in that **you can’t create an object of that class.** However, an abstract class may contain abstract methods but it can also contain implementations, so it is restricted to single inheritance. Together with interfaces, this scheme prevents the need for some mechanism like virtual base classes in C++. To create a version of the interface that can be instantiated, you use the implements keyword, whose syntax looks like inheritance:\n",

    "### Abstract Methods and Classes\n",
    "From Ref4:\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class is a class that is declared abstract—it may or may not include abstract methods. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, but they can be subclassed.\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation (without braces, and followed by a semicolon), like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    abstract void moveTo(double deltaX, double deltaY);\n",
    "\n",
    "If a class includes abstract methods, then the class itself must be declared abstract, as in:\n",
    "\n",
    "    public abstract class GraphicObject {\n",
    "       // declare fields\n",
    "       // declare nonabstract methods\n",
    "       abstract void draw();\n",
    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "When an abstract class is subclassed, the subclass usually provides implementations for all of the abstract methods in its parent class. However, if it does not, then the subclass must also be declared abstract.\n",
    "Note: Methods in an interface (see the Interfaces section) that are not declared as default or static are implicitly abstract, so the abstract modifier is not used with interface methods. (It can be used, but it is unnecessary.)\n",
    "Abstract Classes Compared to Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstract classes are similar to interfaces. You cannot instantiate them, and they may contain a mix of methods declared with or without an implementation. However, with abstract classes, you can declare fields that are not static and final, and define public, protected, and private concrete methods. With interfaces, all fields are automatically public, static, and final, and all methods that you declare or define (as default methods) are public. In addition, you can extend only one class, whether or not it is abstract, whereas you can implement any number of interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Which should you use, abstract classes or interfaces?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Consider using abstract classes if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n",
    "        You want to share code among several closely related classes.\n",
    "        You expect that classes that extend your abstract class have many common methods or fields, or require access modifiers other than public (such as protected and private).\n",
    "        You want to declare non-static or non-final fields. This enables you to define methods that can access and modify the state of the object to which they belong.\n",
    "    Consider using interfaces if any of these statements apply to your situation:\n",
    "        You expect that unrelated classes would implement your interface. For example, the interfaces Comparable and Cloneable are implemented by many unrelated classes.\n",
    "        You want to specify the behavior of a particular data type, but not concerned about who implements its behavior.\n",
    "        You want to take advantage of multiple inheritance of type.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an abstract class in the JDK is AbstractMap, which is part of the Collections Framework. Its subclasses (which include HashMap, TreeMap, and ConcurrentHashMap) share many methods (including get, put, isEmpty, containsKey, and containsValue) that AbstractMap defines.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a class in the JDK that implements several interfaces is HashMap, which implements the interfaces Serializable, Cloneable, and `Map<K, V>`. By reading this list of interfaces, you can infer that an instance of HashMap (regardless of the developer or company who implemented the class) can be cloned, is serializable (which means that it can be converted into a byte stream; see the section Serializable Objects), and has the functionality of a map. In addition, the `Map<K, V>` interface has been enhanced with many default methods such as merge and forEach that older classes that have implemented this interface do not have to define.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that many software libraries use both abstract classes and interfaces; the HashMap class implements several interfaces and also extends the abstract class AbstractMap.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### When an Abstract Class Implements an Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section on Interfaces, it was noted that a class that implements an interface must implement all of the interface's methods. It is possible, however, to define a class that does not implement all of the interface's methods, provided that the class is declared to be abstract. For example,\n",
    "\n",
    "abstract class X implements Y {\n",
    "  // implements all but one method of Y\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "class XX extends X {\n",
    "  // implements the remaining method in Y\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, class X must be abstract because it does not fully implement Y, but class XX does, in fact, implement Y.\n",
    "#### Class Members\n",
    "\n",
    "An abstract class may have static fields and static methods. You can use these static members with a class reference (for example, AbstractClass.staticMethod()) as you would with any other class."

    "* SSH is universally used to remotely log into systems running UNIX and Unix-like OSes. (kp: I think, now we can use it on anything using terminal emulators).\n",
    "    * In the basic form, we use SSH to login with a password, such as follows:\n",
    "        * Enter 'ssh username@remotehostmachinename'\n",
    "        * Enter 'password'\n",
    "    * The remote machine compares the hash of that password to the hass of her password stored on the remote machine, and let's the client in.\n",
    "    * If we have many machines to log into, or if we logout frequently, we will have to enter the corresponding password many times. \n",
    "    * Contrast this to the case where we log in using SSH with a private key. \n",
    "        * In this case we generate a cryptographic Lea(??, 1:22 min) linked public/private key pair in advance.\n",
    "        * Public key is stored in each remote machine that one wants to securely communicate with and the private key is stored only on our local machine.\n",
    "        * When we want to connect, we need to tell SSH about the private key, so SSH can use it to authenticate the session. \n",
    "        * There are **many ways we can tell SSH about our private key. But, one easy ways is to use a piece of software caleld an SSH Agent**.\n",
    "            * **ssh-add** is the command to talk to the **SSH Agent** about our private key.\n",
    "            * We type **ssh-add** and the full path to our private key. When the 'Enter' is presse, we'll be prompted to enter the **passphrase** for our SSH key.\n",
    "                * **Passphrase** and **password** are similar sounding words but they are actually very different concepts. Passwords usually is protects our login to remote as well as local systems. On the other hand, the passphrase protects the private key (stored in our own machine) and is only known by ourselves and never leaves the local machine. This prevents someone who had improperly gained access to our machine from using our private key to log into other remote machines.\n",
    "                * To recap: User enters the passphrase to unlock private key for all connections. Private key is stored only on local machine. Public key is stored on each remote machine.\n",
    "          * Once we enter the passphrase to the private key, we are ready to login to the remote machine using the usual SSH command \"ssh username@remotehostname\" and then entering the passphrase. \n",
    "          * Unlike before when we authenticated our session using a password, now we authenticate our session using the private key.\n",
    "              * When we open ssh connection to the remote machine, the server creates a challenge, which it encrypts using our public key and sends it to the client (us or our machine). The client decrypts the challenge using the private key which only we have access to and then the client replies to the server with a message that includes the original challenge. Now the server is able to determine that the client was able to decrypt the original challenge and let's the newly authenticated client finish connecting.\n",
    "           * At this point, it may appear as if nothing has been gained. Before, we entered one password to log in to one machine. Now we enter one passphrase, to login to one machine. **However, when we go to connect to a second machine, we are logged right in because the SSH agent automatically authenticates the SSH connection with our private key.** This is true for subsequent logins as well. Well this is convenient for a few nodes, but this becomes critical if  you have many machines to use. Now we can log into 10, 20 or 100 machines without having to enter our password 10, 20 or 100 times.\n",
    "           * Finally when we are done for the day, we remove our private key from the SSH agent using **\"ssh -add -D\"** key so if anyone were to improperly gain access to our local machine, then they still could not access our accounts on their remote machines.\n",
    "           * Using SSH with a private key is not only easier to use but it's also more secure than using SSH with a password. This is because the private key is much longer than the eight to 16 character long passwords that you would use instead. Because of the added security, all compute nodes in GENI (kp: OS?) use SSH with a private key. You should never be prompted to enter a password to login to a GENI compute node. If you are, something has always gone wrong. Either you are not specifying the private key or the GENI software has failed to load your public key on your node and you should ask for help."

One example of man-in-the-middle attacks is active eavesdropping, in which the attacker makes independent connections with the victims and relays messages between them to make them believe they are talking directly to each other over a private connection, when in fact the entire conversation is controlled by the attacker. The attacker must be able to intercept all relevant messages passing between the two victims and inject new ones. This is straightforward in many circumstances; for example, an attacker within reception range of an unencrypted wireless access point (Wi-Fi) could insert himself as a man-in-the-middle.[1]\n",

For example, TLS can authenticate one or both parties using a mutually trusted certificate authority.[2]"

(These variables have, in effect, been \"sliced off\".) More subtly, object slicing can also occur when an object of a subclass type is copied to an object of the same type by the superclass's assignment operator, in which case some of the target object's member variables will retain their original values instead of being copied from the source object.\n",
    "\n",
    "This issue is not inherently unique to C++, but it does not occur naturally in most other object-oriented languages — even C++'s relatives such as D, Java, and C# — because copying of objects is not a basic operation in those languages. (Instead, those languages prefer to manipulate objects via implicit references, such that only copying the reference is a basic operation.) In C++, by contrast, objects are copied automatically whenever a function takes an object argument by value or returns an object by value. Additionally, due to the lack of garbage collection in C++, programs will frequently copy an object whenever the ownership and lifetime of a single shared object would be unclear; for example, inserting an object into a standard-library collection, such as a std::vector, actually involves inserting a copy into the collection."

When they are, people get pwned. Thus address space randomization has become popular. Linux randomizes the [stack](http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.28.1/fs/binfmt_elf.c#L542), [memory mapping segment](http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.28.1/arch/x86/mm/mmap.c#L84), and [heap](http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.28.1/arch/x86/kernel/process_32.c#L729) by adding offsets to their starting addresses.

    "The topmost segment in the process address space is the stack, which stores local variables and function parameters in most programming languages. Calling a method or function pushes a new __stack frame__ onto the stack. The stack frame is destroyed when the function returns. This simple design, possible because the data obeys strict [LIFO](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifo) order, means that no complex data structure is needed to track stack contents – a simple pointer to the top of the stack will do. Pushing and popping are thus very fast and deterministic. Also, the constant reuse of stack regions tends to keep active stack memory in the [cpu caches](http://duartes.org/gustavo/blog/post/intel-cpu-caches), speeding up access. Each thread in a process gets its own stack.\n",

If the stack size is below RLIMIT_STACK (usually 8MB), then normally the stack grows and the program continues merrily, unaware of what just happened. This is the normal mechanism whereby stack size adjusts to demand. However, if the maximum stack size has been reached, we have a stack overflow and the program receives a Segmentation Fault. While the mapped stack area expands to meet demand, it does not shrink back when the stack gets smaller. Like the federal budget, it only expands.\n",

Any other access to unmapped memory triggers a page fault that results in a Segmentation Fault. Some mapped areas are read-only, hence write attempts to these areas also lead to segfaults.\n",

    "Below the stack, we have the memory mapping segment. Here the kernel maps contents of files directly to memory. Any application can ask for such a mapping via the Linux [mmap()](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man2/mmap.2.html) system call ([implementation](http://lxr.linux.no/linux+v2.6.28.1/arch/x86/kernel/sys_i386_32.c#L27)) or [CreateFileMapping()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366537(VS.85).aspx) / [MapViewOfFile()](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa366761(VS.85).aspx) in Windows. Memory mapping is a convenient and high-performance way to do file I/O, so it is used for loading dynamic libraries. It is also possible to create an anonymous memory mapping that does not correspond to any files, being used instead for program data. In Linux, if you request a large block of memory via [malloc()](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/malloc.3.html), the C library will create such an anonymous mapping instead of using heap memory. ‘Large’ means larger than MMAP_THRESHOLD bytes, 128 kB by default and adjustable via [mallopt()](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/undocumented.3.html)."

In C, the interface to heap allocation is [malloc()](http://www.kernel.org/doc/man-pages/online/pages/man3/malloc.3.html) and friends, whereas in a garbage-collected language like C# the interface is the new keyword.\n",

    "The name \"stack\" for this type of structure comes from the analogy to a set of physical items stacked on top of each other, which makes it easy to take an item off the top of the stack, while getting to an item deeper in the stack may require taking off multiple other items first.[2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Considered as a linear data structure, or more abstractly a sequential collection, the push and pop operations occur only at one end of the structure, referred to as the top of the stack. This makes it possible to implement a stack as a singly linked list and a pointer to the top element.\n",

    "A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and does not contain enough space to accept an entity to be pushed, the stack is then considered to be in an overflow state. The pop operation removes an item from the top of the stack."

    "There are actually many C memory allocators. And different memory allocators will layout memory in different ways. Currently glibc's memory allocator is `ptmalloc2`. It was forked from dlmalloc. After fork, threading support was added, and was released in 2006. After being integrated, code changes were made directly to glibc's malloc source code itself. So there are many changes with glibc's malloc that is different from the original `ptmalloc2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The malloc in glibc, internally invokes either `brk` or `mmap` syscalls to acquire memory from the OS. The `brk` syscall is generally used to increase the size of the heap, while `mmap` will be used to load shared libraries, create new regions for threads, and many other things. It actually switches to using `mmap` instead of `brk` when the amount of memory requested is larger than the `MMAP_THRESHOLD`. We view which calls are being made by using `strace`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the old days using `dlmalloc`, when 2 threads call malloc at the same time, only one thread can enter the critical section, the freelist data structure of memory chunks is shared among all available threads. Hence memory allocation is a global locking operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "However in ptmalloc2, when 2 threads call malloc at the same time, memory is allocated immediately, since each thread maintains a separate heap, and their own freelist chunk data structure\n",

Major and minor numbers only go up to 255 because it's the largest decimal natural in a single byte. A single byte is: `0b11111111` or `0xFF`.

    "The first thing to realise, is that the memory addresses starts from low to high, but every time you run this program, many of the regions will have different addresses. So that means for some regions, addresses aren't statically allocated. This is actually due to a security feature, by randomising the address space for certain regions, it makes it more difficult for attackers to acquire a particular piece of memory they are interested in. However there are regions that are always fixed, because you need them to be fixed so you know how to load the program. We can see that program data and executable memory is always fixed along with `vsyscall`. It is actually possible to create what people call a \"PIE\" (position independent executable), which actually even makes the program data and executable memory randomised as well, however this is not enabled by default, and it also prevents the program from being compiled statically, forcing it to be linked (https://sourceware.org/ml/binutils/2012-02/msg00249.html). Also \"PIE\" executables incur some performance problems (different kinds of problems on 32 bit vs 64 bit computers). The randomisation of the address for some of the regions is called \"PIC\" (position independent code), and has been enabled by default on Linux for quite some time. For more information, see: http://blog.fpmurphy.com/2008/06/position-independent-executables.html and http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/08/25/load-time-relocation-of-shared-libraries\n",

It turns out that, that entry point is consider the actual point where the OS should start executing, whereas the position between `0x400000` and entry point is used for the EHDR and PHDR, meaning ELF headers and Program Headers. We'll look into this in detail later.\n",

    "Unlike `gcore` or manually dereferencing arbitrary pointers, we can see that `objdump` cannot or will not show us memory contents from `400000 - 400238`. Instead it starts showing from `400238`. This is because the stuff from `400000 - 400238` are not assembly instructions, they are just metadata, so `objdump` doesn't bother with them as it's designed to dump assembly code. Another thing to understand is that the elipsis `        ...` (not shown in the above example) (not to be confused with my own `...` meaning the output is an excerpt) mean null bytes. The `objdump` shows a byte by byte machine code with its decompiled equivalent assembly instruction. This is a disassembler, so the output assembly is not exactly what a human would write, because there can be optimisation, and lots of semantic information is thrown away. It's important to note that the hex addresses on the right represent the starting byte address, if there are multiple hex byte digits on right, that means they are joined up as a single assembly instruction. So the gap between `400251 - 400254` is represented by the 3 hex bytes at `2e 32 00`.\n",

    "We now see our first `[heap]` region. It exactly: 135168 B - 132 KiB. (Currently the same as our stack size!) Remember we allocated specifically 1000 bytes: `addr = (char *) malloc(1000);` at the beginning. So how did a 1000 Bytes become 132 Kibibytes? Well as we said before, anything smaller than `MMAP_THRESHOLD` uses `brk` syscall. It appears that the `brk`/`sbrk` is called with a padded size in order to reduce the number of syscalls made and the number of context switches. Most programs most likely require more heap than 1000 Bytes, so the system may as well pad the `brk` call to cache some heap memory, and new `brk` or `mmap` calls for heap increase will only occur once you exhaust the padded heap of 132 KiB. The padding calculation is done with:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "  /* Request enough space for nb + pad + overhead */\n",
    "  size = nb + mp_.top_pad + MINSIZE;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `mp_.top_pad` is by default set to 128 * 1024 = 128 KiB. We still have 4 KiB difference. But remember our page size `getconf PAGESIZE` gives us 4096, meaning each page is 4 KiB. This means when allocating 1000 Bytes in our program, a full page is allocated being 4 KiB. And 4 KiB + 128 KiB is 132 KiB, which is the size of our heap. This padding is not a padding to a fixed size, but padding that is always added to the amount allocated via `brk`/`sbrk`. This means that 128 KiB by default is always added to how ever much memory you're trying allocate. However this padding only applies to `brk`/`sbrk`, and not `mmap`, remember that the past the `MMAP_THRESHOLD`, `mmap` takes over from `brk`/`sbrk`. Which means the padding will no longer be applied. However I'm not sure whether the `MMAP_THRESHOLD` is checked prior to the padding, or after the padding. It seems like it should be prior to the padding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The padding size can be changed with a call like `mallopt(M_TOP_PAD, 1);`, which changes the `M_TOP_PAD` to be 1 Byte. Mallocing 1000 Bytes now will create only a page of 4 KiB.\n",

    "\n",
    "Why is the older `brk`/`sbrk` getting replaced by newer `mmap`, when an allocation is equal or greater than the `MMAP_THRESHOLD`? Well the `brk`/`sbrk` calls only allow increasing the size of the heap contiguously. If you're just using `malloc` for small things, all of it should be able to be allocated contiguously in the heap, and when it reaches the heap end, the heap can be extended in size without any problems. But for larger allocatiosn, `mmap` is used, and this heap space does need to be contiguously joined with the `brk`/`sbrk` heap space. So it's more flexible. Memory fragmentation is reduced for small objects in this situation. Also the `mmap` call is more flexible, so that `brk`/`sbrk` can be implemented with `mmap`, whereas `mmap` cannot be implemented with `brk`/`sbrk`. One limitation of `brk`/`sbrk`, is that if the top byte in the `brk`/`sbrk` heap space is not freed, the heap size cannot be reduced.\n",

    "It's actually 204800 B + 4096 B = 208 896 B. I'm not sure why an extra 4 KiB is added, because 200 KiB is exactly divisible by the page size of 4 KiB. It maybe another feature. One thing to note is there isn't any kind of obvious way we can pinpoint our program's syscalls over some other syscall, but we can look at the context of the call, that is the previous and subsequent lines to find the exact control flow. Using things like `getchar` can also pause the `strace`. Consider that immeidately after mmapping 204800 bytes, there's a `fstat` and another `mmap` call, before finally `getchar` is called. I have no idea where these calls are coming from, so in the future, we should look for some easy way to label the syscalls so we can find them quicker.

    "As you can see, when malloc switches to using `mmap`, the regions acquired are not part of the so called `[heap]` region, which is only provided by the `brk`/`sbrk` calls. It's unlabelled! We can also see that this kind of heap is not put in the same area as the `brk`/`sbrk` heap, which we understood to start at the low end and grow upwards in address space. Instead this mmapped heap is located in the same area as the shared libraries, putting it at the high end of the reserved user space address range. However this region as shown by `/proc/$PID/maps` is actually 221184 B - 216 KiB. It is exactly 12 KiB from 208896. Another mystery!

Or it could just be extra padding as well.
