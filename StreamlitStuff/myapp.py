# installed 'streamlit' with pip3
#
# During which it suggested to update pip3 with following command:
#     /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# and I indeed updated pip3 with above command
#
# Next I tried to run 'streamlit hello' as suggested in youtube video
#   but during it's run, it recommended to install the Watchdog module
#   for better performance, so I installed that with
#        pip3 install watchdog
#
# Then I ran 'streamlit hello' in the terminal again, which gave a bunch
#    of texts in the terminal that included the following, while also
#    opening a webpage http://localhost:8501/ in my localhost
