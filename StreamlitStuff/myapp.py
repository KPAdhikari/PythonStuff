# installed 'streamlit' with pip3
#
# During which it suggested to update pip3 with following command:
#     /usr/local/opt/python/bin/python3.7 -m pip install --upgrade pip
# and I indeed updated pip3 with above command
#
# Next I tried to run 'streamlit hello' as suggested in youtube video
#   but during it's run, it recommended to install the Watchdog module
#   for better performance, so I installed that with
#        pip3 install watchdog
#
# Then I ran 'streamlit hello' in the terminal again, which gave a bunch
#    of texts in the terminal that included the following, while also
#    opening a webpage http://localhost:8501/ in my localhost

#  Then as the youtube guy did, I am creating this myapp.py file and
#  copying his lines (also installing 'yfinance' with pip3.
#
#  Now to run it, use the following command in the terminal:
#
#          streamlit run myapp.py
#
#  Which will spawn up a web-server (in a browser tab) with the charts
#  The fun part is that if we edit this file and save it, the web-app
#     will detect that and will say "Source file changed." notice along
#     with a convenient "Rerun" button right next to that, making it so
#     easy to update the texts, charts or anything that has been changed.
#     Also, there is "Always Rerun" button next to "Rerun", which when
#     clicked, instead of "Rerun", we don't even have to click any of these
#     buttons later when we have any change in the source file, rather it
#     will automatically rerun/update it.
#
#   It turns out we can also zoom-in and zoom-out the charts with the
#      two-finger pinching in/out moves on the track-pad of my macbook air
#      once we click on the chart first.
#   And, double clicking on it, would take it to the original zooming scale.
