A slider is a Tkinter object with which a user can set a value by moving an indicator. Sliders can be vertically or horizontally arranged. A slider is created with the Scale method().

Using the Scale widget creates a graphical object, which allows the user to select a numerical value by moving a knob along a scale of a range of values. The minimum and maximum values can be set as parameters, as well as the resolution. We can also determine if we want the slider vertically or horizontally positioned. A Scale widget is a good alternative to an Entry widget, if the user is supposed to put in a number from a finite range, i.e. a bounded numerical value.

A Simple Example
'''

#from Tkinter import *
from tkinter import *

master = Tk()
w = Scale(master, from_=0, to=42)
w.pack()
w = Scale(master, from_=0, to=200, orient=HORIZONTAL)
w.pack()

mainloop()
