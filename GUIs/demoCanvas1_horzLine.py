The Canvas widget supplies graphics facilities for Tkinter. Among these graphical objects are lines, circles, images, and even other widgets. With this widget it's possible to draw graphs and plots, create graphics editors, and implement various kinds of custom widgets.

We demonstrate in our first example, how to draw a line.
The method create_line(coords, options) is used to draw a straight line. The coordinates "coords" are given as four integer numbers: x1, y1, x2, y2 This means that the line goes from the point (x1, y1) to the point (x2, y2) After these coordinates follows a comma separated list of additional parameters, which may be empty. We set for example the colour of the line to the special green of our website: fill="#476042"

We kept the first example intentionally very simple. We create a canvas and draw a straight horizontal line into this canvas. This line vertically cuts the canvas into two areas.

The casting to an integer value in the assignment "y = int(canvas_height / 2)" is superfluous, because create_line can work with float values as well. They are automatically turned into integer values. In the following you can see the code of our first simple script:

'''
# Both python2 and python3 worked
from Tkinter import *
#from tkinter import *
master = Tk()

canvas_width = 80
canvas_height = 40
w = Canvas(master,
           width=canvas_width,
           height=canvas_height)
w.pack()

y = int(canvas_height / 2)
w.create_line(0, y, canvas_width, y, fill="#476042")


mainloop()
